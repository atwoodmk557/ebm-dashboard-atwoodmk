## 🚀 GO FIND REAL EVIDENCE!

Start with Athletic Director U - they have the richest practitioner content specifically about college athletics administration challenges. Focus on VIDEO interviews first (ADs speak most candidly in conversation format).

**Remember:** You're looking for **wisdom from experience**, not perfect academic research. Practitioners will have biases - that's okay! Your job is to document what they say AND critically appraise it using Module 4 criteria.
