### Your 5 Videos - Priority Ranking & Time Stamps

**#1 PRIORITY: Julie Cromer (Ohio AD) - 27:54 total**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ BEST for direct coaching retention evidence
- **Watch only:** 0:38, 2:40, 4:30, 9:48 (≈5 min total)
- **0:38** - Establishing coach relationships knowing they might leave
Notes from watching videos- Julie credits Ohio already having a strong culture when she arrived. She said "for any coach, for any AD, any sport going through that transition together bonds you in a way that few other excersices can" she was referring to coaching changes here. She also said that "a bad season, where you get in the trenches toghether, taking a look back on the program and looking at where they wanted to invest and considered where they could be more efficent, this shifted their priorities around and  the football coach made some changes with his staff and they found new resources with them and it helped elevate the program." 
-
- **2:40** - Succession planning for coaching turnover
Notes from video:
"I think you have to be aware of the possibiliy and the market. You have to think about it even if the change isnt pressing. We think about it across our 13 head coaches and 16 ssports. If a program is higher profile you feel that change is looming you feel that possibility is there. You have open dialague with coaches and talk with the to figure out what they need to stay given our limited resources we have at this level. When you have a program like how our football program has been, you realize that is a different kiind of coaching search rather than others. The canditates we talk to were drawn by the strength of the program and we wanted someone who kept our players and furthered our culture so this seach was different than others. 
- **4:30** - Transfer portal retention (Ohio = ONLY FBS with zero losses)
Notes: "I think we are all working our way through that. One thing that I have been open about is to understand that the portal allows students to find their best experience.. Somethimes that means they find it coming to Ohio bu tsomethimes there is a better fit for them elseware. I had an inkling that we could hold our roster together before the Bowl game because I met with our unity consoul the day our coach chagned. They talked about being commited to experiencing the bowl game togheter because the year before we lost several before the bowl game. It was a player led process wehre they all wanted to be together for the bowl game. Our support staff and players did a great job for the bowl game to create the experience fo rthem.  
- **9:48** - "Continuity" and "loyalty" in hiring
Note: "We talk a lot about our football program and the stability of it however, if you are not thioughtful of it it can create complacency. We give them time to recharge.

Ok here are my notes for the first video: Interview with Ohio's Athletic Director Julie Cromer. ADU's very own Steph Garcia Circhosz sat down and interviewed her at the 2025 NCAA Convention. They reflected on the university's first head football coach search in 20 years. Tim Alben was former football coach. Julie has been there for 5 1/2 years. 


**#2 PRIORITY: Kim Durand (Washington Deputy AD) - 16:14 total**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT for stability during turnover

Washington Deputy AD- Kim Durand interviews with ADU's Steph Garcia Cichosz at the 2024 NACDA Convention. 
- **Watch only:** 0:39, 3:03, 6:02 (≈4 min total)
- **0:39** - How to convey stability during 3 AD transitions in 1 year
Notes: "I think if anything college athletics today is about change. I think that the thing that has kept us with our headds up with the changes is our great team. We have coaches commited to the process of continuing to develop and be sucessful. At the heart of it we center it around the student athlete experince. We have been able to make that our soul purpose regardless of the changes incoluding head staff changing or Ad's coming and going. that has sustainned us" 
- **3:03** - Strategies for building trust with new AD quickly
Note: "We are relentlessly commited to our culture and that's our difference maker. We work at it on a dialy bases. A couple things, be open to new ideas and perspectives as we have transitioned thourhg new Ad's and be open to be pushed. Also, it is iimportant to share with new leaders this is what we believe sets us apart and we would like your buy in with that and so let's collab and do that" 
- **6:02** - Messaging stability to student-athletes during transitions
Notes: "Change in senior leadership or AD does not impact our student athletes on the day to day. It impacts our coaches and so it directly impacts our staff and coaches. When we get a new coach then it directly impacts the players and that is when we have to talk to them and get them back to feeling confident about the new coach"  "Coaches are intrecal part of the day to day for student athletes and thier life." 
- **Context:** Navigated 3 AD changes + Head Football Coach change + conference realignment

**#3 PRIORITY: Gene Taylor (Kansas State AD) - 16:14 total**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ VERY GOOD for long-term stability perspective

During the 2024 NACDA Convention. 
- **Watch only:** 7:19 (≈2 min total)
- **7:19** - Contract extension through 2029-30; evaluating skills in stable career stage
Notes: "That is a very nice way to put that im old, its comfortable to be able to have the contract that gives security. We love it here in kansas state. Helping the younger folks in the business that are coming up to help them move up in the business. I aks what fellow Ad's are doing or how they are feeling about things. Not only from the national side but the big 12 lot of exchange between the ideas. I think this is a great busines and I want to get to the point wehre the person who comes behind me has a solid plan in place that I can give them" "Pressure of hiring new coaches and having tough converstaions and being patient to them and to listen to your coaches is the best advice I can give them"  
- **Context:** 20+ years as AD (FCS and FBS), long-term retention thinking

**#4 OPTIONAL: Josh Looney (North Alabama AD) - 26:05 total**
- ⭐⭐⭐ GOOD for culture during transitions
- **Watch only:** 10:10, 13:23 (≈4 min total)
- **10:10** - Ushering D1 transition, keeping momentum

Notes:" My job was to take a program that had already been competing for 3 years and set us apart when we made it to full active emembership D1. With something like that everything is new, you have to celebrate every single thing that happens when something is new. If it aint't broke don't fix it saying I have found that with all the change with college athleticcs, it is a natural thing to see a good thing and to not touch it and focus on the problems. If you ignore the things that have lept you at a high level they start to drop. That has been important to us as we are growing and solving problems."
- **13:23** - Culture-building with existing success
Notes: "I told everyone when I came on do not slow down for me when i am learning, it is my job to catch up to you. You start learning those relationships who is ready for more leadership and who is key to sucessess. When you come into new departments you got people who are nervouse about the new leadership and you have to develope that relationship" 
- **Context:** Less direct on coaching turnover, more on organizational stability

**#5 OPTIONAL: Mike Hill (UNC Charlotte AD) - 18:27 total**
- ⭐⭐ MODERATE for relationship philosophy
- **Watch only:** 2:11, 14:03 (≈3 min total)
- **2:11** - Philosophy on purpose in college athletics
Notes: "Many people in that industry many people are asking themselves right now with all the transformational change we are experiencing. Lots of opeole are leaving because their core values are not aligning with their new aspects of the changes. What matters and why we do what we do. Ath the end of the day its always about the people. I remember a story by Billy Donovan coach in florida and now head coach at chicago bulls, he said "what am I going to do on my death bed lie their with my trophy? it is about the relationships with people that we acomplish what we acomplish." "Family matters more than anything, everything goes away so how you go about your day to day life we sometimes miss what life is really about." 
- **14:03** - Leadership style evolution post-pandemic
Notes: "We talked a lot about it with our staff to take care of themselves during COVID, we have also emphasized mental health which is a crisis in our country. We have provided services to our student athletes and staff. Another peice of it is to tell our staff to just worry about us and to not worry about the external world. That has been sucessul for us.
