# Success Criteria Definition
# Define specific, measurable criteria to evaluate solution effectiveness

## SMART Success Criteria

### Criterion 1: Reduced Coaching Staff Turnover Rate
- **Specific:** Annual coaching staff turnover rate across all sports programs within the athletic department
- **Measurable:** Percentage reduction in voluntary departures from baseline year (target: 25% reduction in turnover within 3 years)
- **Achievable:** Realistic given that research shows retention factors can be addressed through management improvements
- **Relevant:** Directly addresses the core problem of excessive coaching turnover disrupting program stability
- **Time-bound:** Measured annually with 25% improvement target by Year 3, 15% improvement by Year 2

### Criterion 2: Improved Work Balance and Conditions (Research-Based)
- **Specific:** Coach satisfaction scores on work-life balance, job conditions, and workplace support systems
- **Measurable:** Annual satisfaction survey with 5-point Likert scale targeting average scores of 4.0+ on work balance items
- **Achievable:** Based on Inglis & Danylchuk research showing these are controllable retention factors
- **Relevant:** Addresses underlying causes of turnover identified in peer-reviewed research
- **Time-bound:** Baseline survey Year 1, target 4.0+ average by Year 2, sustained through Year 3

### Criterion 3: Enhanced Recognition and Collegial Support Systems
- **Specific:** Implementation and utilization of formal recognition programs, mentorship systems, and peer support networks
- **Measurable:** Number of recognition events, mentorship pairs established, and coach participation rates (target: 80% participation)
- **Achievable:** Programs can be designed and implemented with existing athletic department resources
- **Relevant:** Recognition and collegial support identified as key retention factor in research literature
- **Time-bound:** Programs launched by Month 6, 80% participation achieved by Year 2

## Measurement Framework

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Turnover Rate**: Annual percentage of coaching staff departures (voluntary and involuntary)
- **Retention Rate**: Percentage of coaches remaining after 2+ years in position
- **Time-to-Fill Positions**: Average days to fill vacant coaching positions
- **Satisfaction Scores**: Numerical ratings on work balance, recognition, and inclusivity factors
- **Program Performance**: Win-loss records, recruiting rankings, conference standings
- **Student-Athlete Outcomes**: Graduation rates, transfer rates, academic performance by sport

### Qualitative Indicators
- **Exit Interview Themes**: Common reasons cited for departures
- **Coach Testimonials**: Narrative feedback on work environment improvements
- **Program Stability**: Consistency in coaching philosophies and training approaches
- **Organizational Culture**: Evidence of improved communication, support, and inclusivity
- **Stakeholder Perceptions**: Alumni, donor, and media commentary on program stability

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

#### Leading Indicators (Early signals of progress)
- Number of retention-focused policies implemented
- Coach participation rates in professional development programs
- Frequency of recognition events and mentorship meetings
- Athletic director engagement with coaching staff (meeting frequency)
- Budget allocation increases for coach support programs

#### Lagging Indicators (Final outcomes)
- Annual coaching turnover rates
- Program performance metrics (wins, recruiting success)
- Coach satisfaction survey results
- Student-athlete retention and transfer rates
- External stakeholder confidence measures

## Baseline Measurements

### Current State Metrics
**Coaching Turnover Rate:** [To be established - research industry average ~30% annually]
**Work Balance Satisfaction:** [To be measured via initial survey]
**Recognition Program Participation:** [Current baseline likely 0% - no formal programs]

### Data Collection Plan
- **Annual HR Records**: Track departures, tenure, reasons for leaving
- **Bi-annual Satisfaction Surveys**: Anonymous coach and staff feedback
- **Quarterly Stakeholder Interviews**: Athletic directors, senior administrators
- **Performance Dashboards**: Ongoing monitoring of program metrics

## Success Thresholds

### Minimum Acceptable Improvement
- 15% reduction in coaching turnover within 2 years
- Average satisfaction scores increase from baseline to 3.5+ on 5-point scale
- At least 50% coach participation in new support programs

### Target Performance Level
- 25% reduction in coaching turnover within 3 years
- Average satisfaction scores of 4.0+ on work balance and recognition factors
- 80% coach participation in retention-focused programs

### Stretch Goal
- 40% reduction in turnover, matching industry best practices
- 4.5+ satisfaction scores across all retention factors
- 95% participation with coaches actively recommending programs

## Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria

### Athletic Director Success Measures
- Reduced recruitment disruption and hiring costs
- Improved program performance and stability metrics
- Enhanced donor confidence and stakeholder satisfaction

### Coach Success Measures
- Better work-life balance and job security
- Increased professional development opportunities
- Stronger collegial relationships and recognition

### Student-Athlete Success Measures
- Consistent coaching relationships and training approaches
- Reduced uncertainty about program direction
- Improved athletic and academic outcomes

## Risk Indicators

### Red Flags
- Increased turnover in first year of implementation
- Decreased satisfaction scores despite new programs
- Coach resistance or low participation rates
- Budget constraints limiting program sustainability

### Mitigation Triggers
- If turnover increases by 10% in Year 1, reassess approach
- If satisfaction scores drop below 3.0, investigate implementation issues
- If participation falls below 40%, redesign engagement strategy

[What should improve over time?]

### Long-term (6-12 months)
[What are the ultimate outcomes?]

## Reporting Framework
[How will progress be communicated to stakeholders?]

### Dashboard Metrics
[Key metrics for ongoing monitoring]

### Regular Reports
[What will be reported and how often?]

### Milestone Reviews
[When will formal assessments occur?]
