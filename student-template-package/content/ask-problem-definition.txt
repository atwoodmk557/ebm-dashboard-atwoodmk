## PICOC Framework
### Population (P - Who is affected by this problem?)
- **Primary**: Student-athletes who experience disruption from coaching changes
- **Secondary**: Athletic directors and department administrators responsible for hiring/retention
- **Tertiary**: Coaching staff (both departing and incoming), support staff, recruits and their families, alumni, and university stakeholders

### Intervention (I - What solution/action are we considering?)
Implementing coaching retention strategies including: competitive compensation packages, enhanced job security, professional development programs, improved work-life balance, recognition and support systems, and clear career advancement pathways.

### Comparison (C - What alternatives exist?)
- **Status quo**: Continue current hiring/retention practices
- **Minimal intervention**: Focus only on salary increases
- **Partial solution**: Address only hiring OR retention, not both
- **Alternative approach**: Outsource coaching recruitment to specialized firms

### Outcomes (O - What will success look like?)
- **Reduced coaching turnover rates** (target: 15-20% reduction within 12 months)
- **Improved coaching retention** (longer average tenure in positions)
- **Enhanced program performance** (improved wins, recruiting success, team stability)
- **Higher coach satisfaction** (measured through surveys and retention data)
- **Better athlete outcomes** (improved team performance and athlete development)
- **Increased program stability** (reduced recruitment disruption, consistent team culture)

### Context (C - Where/when does this apply?)
NCAA Division I and II collegiate athletic programs, particularly in competitive conferences where coaching stability impacts recruiting and performance. Most relevant during hiring seasons (typically spring/summer) and applicable across all sports programs within athletic departments.

## Clear Problem Statement
High coaching turnover rates in college athletics are undermining program stability, disrupting athlete development, and negatively impacting team performance and organizational success.

## Why This Problem Matters
### Impact on Organization
Poor coaching management leads to decreased program competitiveness, reduced recruiting effectiveness, increased operational costs from constant hiring/training, damaged reputation affecting donations and enrollment, and potential NCAA compliance issues. Athletic departments lose institutional knowledge and continuity essential for long-term success.

### Stakeholder Impact
**Student-athletes** experience disrupted relationships, inconsistent training methods, and academic-athletic balance challenges. **Coaches** face job insecurity and limited career development. **Athletic directors** struggle with budget pressures and performance expectations. **Alumni and donors** lose confidence in program direction. **University administration** deals with negative publicity and reduced revenue potential.

### Strategic Alignment
Effective coaching management directly supports university goals of student success, competitive excellence, financial sustainability, and institutional reputation. Stable coaching leadership enhances recruitment, improves graduation rates, and generates positive community engagement - all critical to university strategic objectives and long-term viability.
