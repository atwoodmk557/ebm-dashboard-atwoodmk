# Scientific Evidence: Quality Appraisal
# Critically evaluate the trustworthiness and relevance of your research evidence

## Overall Evidence Quality Rating
**Rating:** High
**Confidence Level:** High confidence in coaching retention benefits and organizational impacts of coaching succession

The scientific evidence now includes foundational retention factor research, contemporary analysis of coaching role dynamics, and robust longitudinal evidence demonstrating the organizational costs of coaching turnover and benefits of coaching stability.

## Individual Study Quality Assessment

### Study 1: Understanding Retention Factors in Coaching and Athletic Management Positions (Inglis, Danylchuk & Pastore, 1996)
#### Methodological Quality
- **Study Design Appropriateness:** Good
  - *Justification:* Cross-sectional survey design appropriate for identifying retention factors; principal components analysis well-suited for factor identification
- **Sample Size Adequacy:** Excellent
  - *Justification:* N=359 coaches and athletic administrators provides strong statistical power for factor analysis
- **Measurement Validity:** Good
  - *Justification:* Scale development with empirical validation through PCA with varimax rotation; three clear factors emerged
- **Statistical Analysis:** Good
  - *Justification:* Appropriate use of principal components analysis for identifying underlying retention factor structure

#### Risk of Bias Assessment
- **Selection Bias:** Medium risk
  - Canadian and American intercollegiate sample may not represent all athletic contexts
- **Information Bias:** Low risk
  - Self-report survey but retention factors are appropriately measured through participant perspectives
- **Confounding:** Partially controlled
  - Study acknowledges gender and power relations as important factors but limited control for other organizational variables
- **Reporting Bias:** Low risk
  - Published in peer-reviewed Journal of Sport Management with clear methodology reporting

#### External Validity
- **Population Generalizability:** High
  - *Reasoning:* Sample includes both coaches and athletic administrators across multiple institutions, highly relevant to coaching retention problem
- **Setting Generalizability:** High
  - *Reasoning:* Intercollegiate athletic setting directly matches target context for coaching retention initiatives
- **Time Relevance:** Medium
  - *Reasoning:* 1996 study is dated but retention factors (work balance, recognition, inclusivity) remain relevant core human resource principles

### Study 2: Chasing Stars: Racial Tasking of Recruiting Responsibilities among Power-5 Football Coaches (Corr, Bopp, Atwater et al., 2023)
#### Methodological Quality
- **Study Design Appropriateness:** Good
  - *Justification:* Observational analysis appropriate for examining recruiting patterns; systematic review of Power-5 football programs provides comprehensive coverage
- **Sample Size Adequacy:** Good
  - *Justification:* Analysis of all Power-5 football programs (65 teams) with recruiting classes from 2019-2020 provides substantial data
- **Measurement Validity:** Good
  - *Justification:* Clear operational definitions of recruiting responsibilities and racial composition; uses established recruit rating systems
- **Statistical Analysis:** Good
  - *Justification:* Appropriate descriptive and comparative analysis for examining recruiting task distribution patterns

#### Risk of Bias Assessment
- **Selection Bias:** Low risk
  - Complete sample of Power-5 football programs eliminates selection bias
- **Information Bias:** Low risk
  - Uses publicly available recruiting data and coaching staff information
- **Confounding:** Partially controlled
  - Study acknowledges but doesn't fully control for regional, institutional, or other factors affecting recruiting assignments
- **Reporting Bias:** Low risk
  - Published in peer-reviewed Journal of Intercollegiate Sport with transparent methodology

#### External Validity
- **Population Generalizability:** Medium
  - *Reasoning:* Power-5 football represents highest level but may not generalize to all sports or division levels relevant to coaching retention
- **Setting Generalizability:** Medium
  - *Reasoning:* Football coaching staff dynamics may differ from other sports, but basic retention factors likely apply across sports
- **Time Relevance:** High
  - *Reasoning:* Very recent study (2023) using 2019-2020 data, highly current for understanding coaching dynamics

### Study 3: Leadership Succession and Organizational Performance: Football Coaches and Organizational Issues (Soebbing & Washington, 2011)
#### Methodological Quality
- **Study Design Appropriateness:** Excellent
  - *Justification:* Longitudinal panel data design (1950-2009) ideal for examining succession effects over time; uses Arellano-Bond dynamic panel estimator appropriate for this type of analysis
- **Sample Size Adequacy:** Excellent
  - *Justification:* Nearly 60 years of NCAA Division I football data provides massive sample size and statistical power
- **Measurement Validity:** Excellent
  - *Justification:* Clear operational definitions of leadership succession and organizational performance; uses established performance metrics
- **Statistical Analysis:** Excellent
  - *Justification:* Sophisticated econometric methods (dynamic panel data estimation) appropriate for longitudinal organizational performance analysis

#### Risk of Bias Assessment
- **Selection Bias:** Low risk
  - Comprehensive sample of NCAA Division I football programs over extended period
- **Information Bias:** Low risk
  - Uses objective performance measures and publicly available coaching change data
- **Confounding:** Well controlled
  - Controls for multiple organizational and environmental factors affecting performance
- **Reporting Bias:** Low risk
  - Published in top-tier Journal of Sport Management with rigorous peer review

#### External Validity
- **Population Generalizability:** High
  - *Reasoning:* NCAA Division I football coaching succession directly parallels your coaching retention context across athletic departments
- **Setting Generalizability:** High
  - *Reasoning:* College athletics setting with coaching leadership roles directly matches your intervention context
- **Time Relevance:** High
  - *Reasoning:* While 2011 publication, findings about succession effects and tenure benefits remain highly relevant to contemporary coaching retention
- **Information Bias:** [Low/Medium/High risk]
- **Confounding:** [Well controlled/Partially controlled/Poorly controlled]
- **Reporting Bias:** [Low/Medium/High risk]

#### External Validity
- **Population Generalizability:** [High/Medium/Low]
  - *Reasoning:* [How similar is study population to your context?]
- **Setting Generalizability:** [High/Medium/Low]
  - *Reasoning:* [How similar is study setting to your context?]
- **Time Relevance:** [High/Medium/Low]
  - *Reasoning:* [How current/relevant is this research?]

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Be honest about study limitations - don't oversell weak evidence
2. Consider both internal validity (study quality) and external validity (generalizability)
3. Look for patterns across studies, not just individual study quality
4. Consider what evidence is missing, not just what's available
5. Connect quality assessment back to your specific decision-making needs
