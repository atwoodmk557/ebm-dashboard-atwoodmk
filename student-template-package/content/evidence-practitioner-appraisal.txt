## Evidence Quality Assessment

### Consistency Across Sources
#### Consistent Messages
Multiple practitioners consistently emphasize several key strategies:
- **Competitive compensation packages** - All sources agree that below-market salaries are primary retention risk
- **Clear career advancement pathways** - Both ADs and coaches stress importance of growth opportunities
- **Robust onboarding and mentoring programs** - HR professionals and successful coaches highlight systematic support
- **Job security frameworks** - Contract terms and performance expectations need to be transparent and reasonable
- **Professional development funding** - Investment in coaches' continued learning and networking is universally recommended
- **Structured coach development programs** - Van Mullem & Croft (2020) emphasize systematic career progression support as essential for retention
- **Coach developer roles** - Consistent emphasis on having dedicated personnel to guide coaching career development

#### Inconsistent or Conflicting Advice
Some areas where practitioners disagree:
- **Compensation structure** - Split between merit-based vs. experience-based pay scales
- **Contract length** - Disagreement on optimal contract terms (3-5 years vs. 5-7 years)
- **Performance metrics** - Varying views on how heavily to weight wins vs. other factors
- **Hiring speed** - Tension between thorough vetting and rapid hiring to secure top candidates

#### Pattern Recognition
Patterns emerging across different contexts:
- **Size matters** - Smaller programs focus more on mentoring/support, larger programs emphasize compensation
- **Sport-specific needs** - Revenue sports require different retention strategies than non-revenue sports
- **Institutional culture** - Universities with strong athletic traditions have different leverage points
- **Regional differences** - Cost of living and cultural factors influence strategy effectiveness

### Depth and Specificity
#### Detailed vs. General Advice
**Detailed recommendations include:**
- Specific compensation benchmarking methodologies (using NACDA salary surveys)
- Step-by-step onboarding protocols (90-day integration plans)
- Concrete performance metrics (recruiting rankings, GPA targets, graduation rates)
- Detailed contract language examples for job security provisions

**General advice tends to focus on:**
- "Building relationships" without specific relationship-building strategies
- "Creating positive culture" without measurable culture indicators
- "Investing in coaches" without specific investment amounts or types

#### Evidence-Based vs. Opinion-Based
**Evidence-backed recommendations:**
- Compensation strategies supported by retention data and industry benchmarks
- Onboarding programs with measured outcomes (time-to-productivity, satisfaction scores)
- Performance metrics tied to specific institutional goals and historical data
- **Systematic coach development programs** - Van Mullem & Croft (2020) provide research-informed framework for coaching career progression and professional development
- **Coach developer role implementation** - Evidence-based approach to supporting coaching career advancement

**Opinion-based advice:**
- Preferences for certain personality types in hiring
- Beliefs about generational differences in coaching motivations
- Assumptions about work-life balance priorities without supporting data

#### Implementation Detail
**High implementation detail:**
- HR processes include specific timelines, responsible parties, and resource requirements
- Compensation restructuring includes budget impact analysis and rollout phases
- Performance management systems include evaluation forms, review cycles, and improvement protocols

**Limited implementation detail:**
- Cultural change initiatives lack specific action steps
- Mentoring programs miss matching criteria and success metrics
- Professional development lacks budget allocation and approval processes

## Context Relevance Assessment

## Context Relevance Assessment

### Practitioner Context Match
#### Industry Alignment
- **Perfect Match:** Dr. Sarah Chen (Athletic Director) - exact industry and role match
- **Close Match:** Coach Mike Rodriguez - same industry, different perspective (coach vs. administrator)
- **Different but Relevant:** Jennifer Walsh (HR Director) - same institution type, specialized HR perspective

#### Organizational Context
- **Size Similarity:** All practitioners work at mid-size Division I institutions (15-25 sports programs)
- **Culture Similarity:** Mix of competitive athletic cultures with academic mission alignment
- **Resource Similarity:** Similar budget constraints and funding challenges across sources

#### Problem Similarity
- **Identical Problems:** All practitioners have direct experience with coaching turnover challenges
- **Similar Problems:** Consistent issues with retention across different sports and competitive levels
- **Analogous Problems:** HR practitioner deals with broader staff retention but coaching-specific insights

### Geographic and Cultural Factors
#### Cultural Relevance
Practitioners represent different geographic regions (West Coast, Midwest, Southeast) but all within American intercollegiate athletics culture. Cultural differences are minimal within this context, though regional recruiting and cost-of-living variations affect implementation details.

#### Regulatory Environment
All practitioners operate under similar NCAA regulations and Title IX compliance requirements. Conference-level variations exist but core regulatory framework is consistent across sources.

#### Market Conditions
Practitioners represent different competitive markets - some in high-cost urban areas, others in smaller college towns. This affects compensation strategies but core retention principles remain applicable across contexts.

## Bias and Limitation Analysis

### Potential Biases

### Potential Biases

#### Selection Bias
Sources primarily represent successful practitioners who have implemented retention strategies. Missing perspectives from institutions with high turnover or failed retention initiatives. Geographic bias toward certain regions and institution types.

#### Survival Bias
Heavy emphasis on success stories and positive outcomes. Limited discussion of failed retention attempts or strategies that didn't work. Case studies tend to highlight institutions that solved their retention problems.

#### Confirmation Bias
Practitioners may emphasize solutions that align with their expertise or past successes. Athletic directors focus on administrative solutions, coaches emphasize coach-centered needs, HR professionals highlight systematic approaches.

#### Recency Bias
Recent successful implementations may be overweighted relative to historical patterns. COVID-19 impacts on athletics may not represent normal operating conditions for retention strategies.

### Information Limitations

### Information Limitations

#### Sample Size
Limited to three primary practitioners and two case studies. Would benefit from broader representation across different institution types, sports, and geographic regions.

#### Depth vs. Breadth
Good depth from individual practitioners but limited breadth across the full spectrum of athletic department contexts. Missing perspectives from smaller Division II/III institutions and community colleges.

#### Missing Perspectives
- Coaches who left voluntarily and their reasons
- Athletic directors from institutions with ongoing retention problems
- Financial officers who can speak to budget constraints
- Student-athlete perspectives on coaching stability

#### Context Gaps
- Non-revenue sport coaching retention (focus has been on high-profile sports)
- Private vs. public institution differences
- Different conference level experiences (Power 5 vs. mid-major vs. small conference)
