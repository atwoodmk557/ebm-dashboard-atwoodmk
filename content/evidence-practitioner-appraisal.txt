# Practitioner Evidence: Credibility & Relevance Assessment
# Critical Appraisal of Practitioner Insights Using CEBMa Module 4 Framework

## Overall Credibility Assessment

**Overall Rating:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Confidence in Recommendations:** MEDIUM-HIGH for culture/succession planning strategies; MEDIUM for financial investment guidance  
**Evidence Base:** 5 Athletic Directors from published interviews/articles (3 video sources, 2 written articles)

### Summary Judgment

The practitioner evidence demonstrates **strong convergent validation** of the X→M→Y hypothesis (coaching turnover → recruiting disruption → performance decline) from multiple independent sources. All 5 practitioners are experienced Athletic Directors with direct responsibility for coaching retention decisions, providing relevant institutional perspective. 

**Strengths:**
- Good diversity across conferences (MAC, Big Ten, Big 12), institutional contexts (stability vs. instability), and experience levels (5.5 to 20+ years)
- Measurable outcomes cited (Cromer: "zero transfer portal losses"; Cunningham: 125% salary increase; Bjork: $76M buyout)
- Convergent themes across 4-5 practitioners (culture preservation, proactive planning, coaching relationship priority)
- Mix of stability cases (Cromer 20-year tenure) and instability cases (Cunningham 3 coaches in 5 years) prevents selection bias

**Limitations:**
- All sources are Athletic Directors (no direct head coach voice on what makes THEM stay)
- Limited quantitative data beyond individual examples
- Potential social desirability bias in public interview/article settings
- Time-bound sources (2022-2025) may not capture longer historical patterns
- Missing detailed discussion of failed retention attempts

**Overall Assessment:** The practitioner evidence is **credible and useful** for understanding institutional retention strategies, with appropriate caution about bias risks and generalizability limitations. Confidence level sufficient to inform retention strategy recommendations when combined with other evidence types (scientific, organizational, stakeholder).

## Individual Practitioner Credibility Assessments

### Practitioner 1: Julie Cromer - Ohio University Athletic Director

#### Professional Credentials
- **Title:** Director of Athletics, Ohio University (MAC Conference)
- **Experience:** 5.5 years at Ohio University; oversight of 16 sports and 13 head coaches
- **Industry Context:** Mid-major FBS athletics; first major coaching search in 20 years (football)
- **Relevant Achievement:** "ONLY FBS with zero losses" in transfer portal during coaching transition
- **Source:** Athletic Director U video interview, 2025 NCAA Convention (27:54 minutes)

#### Expertise Validity Assessment (CEBMa Module 4 - Four Criteria)

**1. Narrow/Specific Domain?** ✅ **YES**
- Division I athletic administration at mid-major FBS level
- Specific focus on coaching transitions and succession planning
- Revenue sports emphasis (football, basketball) with Olympic sports oversight
- **Assessment:** Meets narrow domain criterion

**2. Repeated Practice Opportunities?** ✅ **YES**
- Manages 13 head coaches across 16 sports (repeated coaching relationship management)
- Direct experience with football coaching succession after 20-year tenure
- Ongoing retention conversations across multiple sports
- **Assessment:** Sufficient repeated practice for pattern recognition

**3. Direct, Objective Feedback?** ✅ **YES - STRONG**
- **Measurable outcome:** Transfer portal retention = 0 losses (only FBS program with this achievement)
- Observable recruiting class stability
- Team performance metrics available
- Staff continuity/turnover observable
- **Assessment:** Excellent direct feedback - quantitative outcome data provides clear signal

**4. Regular, Predictable Environment?** ✅ **MOSTLY YES**
- MAC Conference provides relatively stable competitive context
- Ohio University has stable institutional leadership
- Recent coaching transition introduced some variability
- **Assessment:** Mostly predictable environment; recent transition adds complexity but doesn't fundamentally undermine expertise

**Overall Expertise Validity:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **HIGH VALIDITY** - Meets all 4 criteria, with particularly strong direct feedback via measurable transfer portal retention outcome.

#### Cognitive Bias Assessment

**Biases Detected:**
1. **Outcome Bias (MEDIUM RISK):** May judge 20-year coaching stability too favorably based on successful transition outcome (zero portal losses). Could underestimate risks or luck factors in achieving this result.

2. **Availability Bias (MEDIUM RISK):** Recent coaching transition highly salient in current experience; may overweight this single case when generalizing about succession planning effectiveness.

3. **Social Desirability Bias (LOW-MEDIUM RISK):** Interview at NCAA Convention with professional peer audience may encourage emphasizing positive outcomes rather than challenges/failures. However, does acknowledge "you have to be aware of the possibility and the market" showing some realism.

4. **Patternicity Risk (LOW RISK):** Possible attribution of successful transition solely to succession planning without acknowledging other factors (coach fit, timing, market conditions, institutional support). However, quotes suggest awareness of multiple factors ("continuity and loyalty," market awareness).

**Bias Mitigation Observed:**
- ✅ Acknowledges market realities: "be aware of the possibility and the market" shows System 2 thinking
- ✅ Uses measurable outcome: Transfer portal data (zero losses) provides objective feedback beyond subjective judgment
- ✅ Recognizes cultural factors beyond individual decisions
- ❌ Limited discussion of failures or what didn't work (may reflect interview format constraints)

**Credibility Rating:** **HIGH** - Strong expertise validity + measurable outcomes + awareness of market forces = credible insights despite moderate bias risks

**Confidence Level:** **HIGH** for succession planning recommendations; **MEDIUM** for generalizability beyond mid-major context

---

### Practitioner 2: Kim Durand - University of Washington Deputy AD/SWA

#### Professional Credentials
- **Title:** Deputy Athletic Director / Senior Woman Administrator, University of Washington (Big Ten Conference)
- **Experience:** Navigated 3 Athletic Director transitions + head coach change + conference realignment (Pac-12→Big Ten) all within one year
- **Industry Context:** Power 5 athletics; extreme organizational instability case
- **Relevant Insight:** Explicit distinction between AD changes (strategic level) vs. coaching changes (operational/relational level)
- **Source:** Athletic Director U video interview, 2024 NACDA Convention (16:14 minutes)

#### Expertise Validity Assessment (CEBMa Module 4 - Four Criteria)

**1. Narrow/Specific Domain?** ✅ **YES**
- Division I Power 5 athletic administration
- Specific focus on culture preservation during transitions
- Deputy AD role provides continuity perspective during leadership changes
- **Assessment:** Meets narrow domain criterion

**2. Repeated Practice Opportunities?** ✅ **YES**
- 3 AD transitions in one year = intensive repeated practice with leadership change management
- Multiple coaching relationships across sports
- Conference transition management (Pac-12 to Big Ten)
- **Assessment:** Unusual level of repeated practice with instability management (3 ADs in 1 year)

**3. Direct, Objective Feedback?** ✅ **YES**
- Observable student-athlete retention during transitions
- Team performance continuity measurable
- Staff stability/turnover observable
- **Assessment:** Clear feedback available on whether culture preservation strategies worked

**4. Regular, Predictable Environment?** ❌ **NO**
- **Highly variable environment:** 3 ADs, conference change, coaching turnover, conference realignment
- Unpredictable strategic direction with frequent leadership changes
- **Assessment:** FAILS predictable environment criterion per Module 4

**Overall Expertise Validity:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **MEDIUM-HIGH VALIDITY** - Meets 3 of 4 criteria strongly; unpredictable environment reduces expertise validity per Module 4. HOWEVER, her insights on managing instability are valuable precisely BECAUSE environment was chaotic - she offers expertise in crisis management, not steady-state management.

#### Cognitive Bias Assessment

**Biases Detected:**
1. **Social Desirability Bias (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK):** Interview at NACDA Convention with professional audience may encourage emphasizing organizational resilience narrative. "Relentlessly committed to our culture" may be aspirational messaging rather than candid assessment of challenges.

2. **Confirmation Bias (MEDIUM RISK):** After deciding culture commitment was the solution, may selectively recall evidence supporting this strategy while discounting what didn't work or costs incurred.

3. **Group Conformity (MEDIUM RISK):** As Deputy AD during 3 AD transitions, may have conformed to new leaders' preferences rather than maintaining independent judgment. Role requires adapting to multiple bosses' visions.

4. **Availability Bias (LOW-MEDIUM RISK):** Recent extreme instability (3 ADs in 1 year) highly salient and unusual - may not generalize to more typical athletic department contexts.

**Bias Mitigation Observed:**
- ✅ Distinguishes between different types of changes (AD vs. coach) showing nuanced thinking
- ✅ Acknowledges reality that AD changes occur ("not impact...day to day") rather than claiming no disruption
- ✅ Uses clear categorization: leadership changes vs. operational relationships
- ❌ Limited acknowledgment of what failed or costs of instability (may reflect professional courtesy)

**Credibility Rating:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Unique extreme instability context limits generalizability BUT her distinction between coaching and administrative impact is valuable and observable.

**Confidence Level:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** for her core insight (coaching changes directly affect athletes; AD changes affect strategy); **MEDIUM** for culture preservation strategies' effectiveness (unpredictable environment per Module 4 criterion #4 suggests expertise limitations)

---

### Practitioner 3: Gene Taylor - Kansas State University Athletic Director

#### Professional Credentials
- **Title:** Director of Athletics, Kansas State University (Big 12 Conference)
- **Experience:** 20+ years as Athletic Director (FCS and FBS levels); contract extension through 2029-30
- **Industry Context:** Power 5 athletics; long-term program building; stable institutional context
- **Relevant Insight:** Emphasis on "patience" and "tough conversations" as retention strategies
- **Source:** Athletic Director U video interview, 2024 NACDA Convention (16:14 minutes)

#### Expertise Validity Assessment (CEBMa Module 4 - Four Criteria)

**1. Narrow/Specific Domain?** ✅ **YES**
- Division I athletic administration
- Specific focus on coaching relationships and program building
- 20+ years concentrated in AD role = deep domain expertise
- **Assessment:** Meets narrow domain criterion with exceptional depth

**2. Repeated Practice Opportunities?** ✅ **YES - EXTENSIVE**
- 20+ years managing multiple sports = dozens of coaching hires/retention decisions
- Long tenure at Kansas State enables observation of long-term outcomes
- Experience across FCS and FBS levels provides range
- **Assessment:** Exceptional repeated practice - pattern recognition across coaching cycles

**3. Direct, Objective Feedback?** ✅ **YES**
- 20+ years of observable outcomes: program performance trends, coaching tenure patterns, retention success rates
- Long-term perspective allows seeing multi-year consequences of decisions
- **Assessment:** Excellent long-term feedback loop enables learning from outcomes

**4. Regular, Predictable Environment?** ✅ **MOSTLY YES**
- Big 12 Conference provides relatively stable context
- Long tenure at Kansas State (contract through 2029-30) = predictable institutional environment
- Some variability from conference realignment but overall stable
- **Assessment:** Mostly predictable environment supports expertise development

**Overall Expertise Validity:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **HIGH VALIDITY** - Meets all 4 criteria with particularly strong repeated practice (20+ years) and long-term feedback. Veteran perspective enables pattern recognition across coaching cycles.

#### Cognitive Bias Assessment

**Biases Detected:**
1. **Overconfidence Bias (MEDIUM RISK):** 20+ years experience may lead to unwarranted confidence in own judgment about coaching decisions. "I've seen it all" mindset can reduce openness to new information or disconfirming evidence.

2. **Outcome Bias (MEDIUM RISK):** Successful career (contract extension through 2029-30) may lead to attributing success to patience strategy without considering survivor bias, alternative explanations, or role of luck/timing.

3. **Confirmation Bias (LOW-MEDIUM RISK):** May seek evidence supporting patience approach while discounting cases where quick changes were appropriate or patience was excessive.

4. **Authority Bias (LOW RISK):** As veteran AD, may overvalue own past decisions and approaches; interview format at NACDA Convention positions him as authority figure.

**Bias Mitigation Observed:**
- ✅ Acknowledges difficulty: "Tough conversations" shows awareness that his approach isn't easy or always comfortable
- ✅ Recognizes ongoing pressure: "Patience" as challenge implies constant temptation toward impatience (not claiming patience is easy)
- ✅ Long-term feedback loop: 20+ years provides extensive direct feedback on retention decisions, meeting Module 4 criterion
- ❌ Limited specific examples of failures or times patience didn't work (may reflect interview brevity)

**Credibility Rating:** **HIGH** - Exceptional expertise validity (all 4 Module 4 criteria met) with 20+ years repeated practice. Overconfidence bias risk exists but mitigated by long feedback loop.

**Confidence Level:** **HIGH** for patience and proactive communication recommendations; **MEDIUM** for generalizability across contexts (his stable Big 12 environment may not apply to high-turnover environments)

---

### Practitioner 4: Ross Bjork - Ohio State University Athletic Director

#### Professional Credentials
- **Title:** Director of Athletics, Ohio State University (Big Ten Conference); former AD at Texas A&M and Ole Miss
- **Experience:** Multi-institutional AD experience; managed major coaching transitions including Jimbo Fisher $76M+ buyout (described as "most expensive buyout in history of college football")
- **Industry Context:** Elite Power 5 / premier program athletics; $100M+ athletic budgets; high-stakes coaching decisions
- **Relevant Insight:** Leadership overlap importance; extreme coaching change costs; scale-appropriate governance
- **Source:** Sports Business Journal article, January 18, 2024 (AD transition announcement)

#### Expertise Validity Assessment (CEBMa Module 4 - Four Criteria)

**1. Narrow/Specific Domain?** ✅ **YES**
- Elite Power 5 athletic administration
- Specific experience with major coaching contract decisions and buyouts
- High-profile program management (Ole Miss, Texas A&M, Ohio State)
- **Assessment:** Meets narrow domain criterion at elite program level

**2. Repeated Practice Opportunities?** ✅ **YES**
- Multi-institutional experience (3 major AD roles: Ole Miss, Texas A&M, Ohio State)
- Managed multiple high-stakes coaching decisions across institutions
- Fisher buyout + other coaching transitions = repeated practice with retention/termination
- **Assessment:** Sufficient repeated practice across different institutional contexts

**3. Direct, Objective Feedback?** ✅ **YES - VERY STRONG**
- **Highly measurable outcomes:** $76M buyout cost = clear financial feedback
- Program performance results observable
- Budget management outcomes quantifiable
- **Assessment:** Excellent objective feedback - financial consequences very concrete

**4. Regular, Predictable Environment?** ⚠️ **PARTIAL**
- High-profile programs create volatile environment with intense external pressures (media, donors, fans)
- Institutional transitions (changing AD roles across 3 universities) add variability
- Elite program context somewhat predictable (resource-rich, high expectations) but external pressures variable
- **Assessment:** Partially predictable - consistent elite context but high external pressure variability

**Overall Expertise Validity:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **MEDIUM-HIGH VALIDITY** - Meets 3 of 4 criteria strongly; environment predictability somewhat compromised by institutional transitions and high-stakes context. Financial feedback is very direct and objective, which strengthens validity.

#### Cognitive Bias Assessment

**Biases Detected:**
1. **Outcome Bias (HIGH RISK):** Fisher buyout decision will be judged by Texas A&M's subsequent coaching success/failure, not decision quality at time it was made. Buyout amount may overshadow process analysis.

2. **Hindsight Bias (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK):** Article written after AD hiring decision made - may rationalize timing and process ex post facto. "Overlap time" strategy may be presented as more intentional than it was.

3. **Social Desirability Bias (HIGH RISK):** Article context is PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT of AD transition - strong incentive to present positive messaging about transition planning vs. candid discussion of challenges or uncertainties.

4. **Authority Bias (MEDIUM RISK):** President Carter's involvement in hiring may create deference to institutional leadership preferences. "Unified vision" language may mask disagreements or compromises.

5. **Availability Bias (MEDIUM RISK):** Fisher buyout highly salient as "most expensive in history" - may overweight this extreme case in future coaching decisions, leading to risk aversion or overcorrection.

**Bias Mitigation Observed:**
- ✅ Acknowledges information challenges: "information was starting to leak" shows awareness of imperfect control
- ✅ President Carter's transparency: "no secrets once you get into interviews" suggests deliberate openness
- ✅ Focus on process: Overlap time emphasis indicates System 2 thinking about transition mechanics, not just outcomes
- ✅ Financial objectivity: $76M buyout is measurable, objective feedback on coaching change costs
- ❌ Article format limits candor: Public announcement context creates strong social desirability pressure

**Credibility Rating:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Multi-institutional experience provides repeated practice; financial outcomes very objective and measurable. HOWEVER, article format (public announcement vs. candid interview) and high-stakes context limit confidence. Fisher buyout provides extreme data point that may not generalize to typical programs.

**Confidence Level:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** for financial consequence insights (buyout costs, transition costs); **MEDIUM** for transition overlap strategy (may be more aspirational than realistic given "leaks" mentioned); **LOW-MEDIUM** for generalizability beyond elite programs

---

### Practitioner 5: John Cunningham - University of Cincinnati Athletic Director

#### Professional Credentials
- **Title:** Director of Athletics, University of Cincinnati (Big 12 Conference, transitioning from American Athletic Conference)
- **Experience:** Managing major conference transition (AAC to Big 12); addressing program instability from coaching turnover
- **Industry Context:** Men's basketball program stabilization; Cincinnati had "third head coach in the last five seasons" creating instability
- **Relevant Decision:** Wes Miller contract extension (salary increased 125% from $1.31M to $2.95M) after "fast start" (2 seasons)
- **Source:** The Athletic article, December 14, 2022 (contract extension announcement)

#### Expertise Validity Assessment (CEBMa Module 4 - Four Criteria)

**1. Narrow/Specific Domain?** ✅ **YES**
- Division I basketball program management
- Specific focus on coaching retention during conference transition
- Revenue sport at program with recent instability = relevant domain
- **Assessment:** Meets narrow domain criterion

**2. Repeated Practice Opportunities?** ⚠️ **PARTIAL/UNCLEAR**
- Article doesn't specify Cunningham's tenure length or prior AD experience
- Cincinnati's "third coach in five seasons" suggests LIMITED repeated practice with long-term retention (program experienced turnover, not stability)
- Miller extension is retention decision, but success not yet validated (extension announced 2022)
- **Assessment:** Unclear/insufficient information on repeated practice; program's instability history suggests limited expertise in retention success

**3. Direct, Objective Feedback?** ✅ **YES**
- Observable outcomes available: recruiting class results, program performance in Big 12, coaching tenure longevity, player retention
- Can measure whether extension achieves stated goal of "restoring identity and stability"
- **Assessment:** Clear feedback mechanisms available, though outcomes still unfolding (2022 extension)

**4. Regular, Predictable Environment?** ❌ **NO**
- Major conference transition (AAC to Big 12) creates unpredictable competitive and financial environment
- "Third coach in five seasons" indicates recent organizational instability
- New conference = different competitive standards, resources, expectations
- **Assessment:** FAILS predictable environment criterion - too much organizational turbulence

**Overall Expertise Validity:** ⭐⭐⭐ **MEDIUM VALIDITY** - Meets 2 of 4 criteria clearly (narrow domain, direct feedback available); limited/unclear repeated practice with stability; unpredictable environment during conference transition. His insights valuable BECAUSE he's addressing instability problem, but limited expertise in successful retention (given program's recent history).

#### Cognitive Bias Assessment

**Biases Detected:**
1. **Outcome Bias (HIGH RISK):** Extension decision after "fast start" (2 seasons) may overweight early success without adequate long-term data. Two seasons may be insufficient to evaluate program trajectory, especially with conference transition pending.

2. **Confirmation Bias (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK):** After deciding Miller is "right coach," may seek evidence supporting extension decision while discounting risks (conference transition challenges, limited track record, etc.).

3. **Social Desirability Bias (VERY HIGH RISK):** Article is PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT of contract extension - extremely strong incentive to present positive rationale. "Restoring identity" and "stabilizing program" language may be aspirational messaging rather than evidence-based prediction.

4. **Availability Bias (MEDIUM RISK):** "Fast start" recent performance highly salient - may underweight systemic challenges (conference transition difficulty, recruiting in new conference, schedule strength changes).

5. **Patternicity Risk (MEDIUM RISK):** Attributing early success to Miller specifically vs. other factors (recruiting class he inherited, schedule strength, momentum from previous regime, etc.). Two seasons may be too short to establish causal patterns.

**Bias Mitigation Observed:**
- ✅ Acknowledges past failures: "Third coach in five seasons" shows awareness of historical instability problem (not claiming everything is fine)
- ✅ Uses clear problem framing: "Restoring identity" and "stabilizing program" indicate System 2 analysis of what's needed
- ✅ Contextualizes decision: Conference transition timing shows strategic thinking beyond just performance
- ✅ Measurable outcomes available: Can observe recruiting results, conference performance, player retention over extension period
- ❌ Article format limits candor: Public announcement of major investment creates very high social desirability pressure
- ❌ Limited discussion of risks or uncertainties: Extension presented as clear solution without acknowledging unknowns

**Credibility Rating:** **MEDIUM** - Cincinnati's recent instability (3 coaches in 5 years) suggests LIMITED repeated practice with successful retention. Conference transition creates unpredictable environment (Module 4 criterion #4 not met). Article format (public announcement) creates high social desirability bias risk.

**Key Value:** Cunningham's EXPLICIT VALIDATION of X→M→Y hypothesis ("third coach in five seasons" created need to "restore identity and stability") is valuable despite moderate credibility concerns. His problem articulation is clearer than solution effectiveness.

| **Gene Taylor** | ✅ YES | ✅ YES (20+ years) | ✅ YES | ✅ MOSTLY YES | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH |
| **Ross Bjork** | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | ✅ YES (financial data) | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM-HIGH |
| **John Cunningham** | ✅ YES | ⚠️ UNCLEAR | ✅ YES | ❌ NO (conference transition) | ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM |

**Key Findings:**
- **STRONGEST EXPERTISE:** Julie Cromer and Gene Taylor meet all 4 Module 4 criteria with measurable outcomes
- **ENVIRONMENT CHALLENGES:** Durand and Cunningham operate in unpredictable environments, reducing expertise validity per Module 4
- **REPEATED PRACTICE:** Taylor's 20+ years provides exceptional pattern recognition; Cunningham's program instability history limits retention expertise
- **OBJECTIVE FEEDBACK:** Cromer's transfer portal data, Bjork's financial outcomes, and measurable retention metrics strengthen credibility

### Cognitive Bias Risk Summary

| Practitioner | Highest Risk Biases | Bias Mitigation Observed | Net Credibility |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Cromer** | Outcome bias, Availability bias | Market awareness, quantitative metrics | HIGH |
| **Durand** | Social desirability, Confirmation bias, Group conformity | Nuanced distinctions (AD vs. coach changes) | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| **Taylor** | Overconfidence, Outcome bias | Acknowledges difficulty of patience approach | HIGH |
| **Bjork** | Social desirability (VERY HIGH), Outcome bias, Hindsight bias | Financial objectivity, acknowledges leaks | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| **Cunningham** | Social desirability (VERY HIGH), Outcome bias, Patternicity | Acknowledges past failures explicitly | MEDIUM |

**Key Patterns:**
- **PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT BIAS:** Bjork and Cunningham sources are contract/hiring announcements with high social desirability pressure
- **VIDEO INTERVIEW ADVANTAGES:** Cromer, Durand, Taylor video sources provide more authentic practitioner voice
- **OUTCOME BIAS WIDESPREAD:** All practitioners judge strategies partly by results, not just decision process quality
- **LIMITED FAILURE DISCUSSION:** Across all sources, minimal detailed analysis of what DIDN'T work (may reflect professional courtesy or interview format)

### Source Format Impact on Credibility

**Video Interviews (Cromer, Durand, Taylor) - HIGHER CREDIBILITY:**
- Professional interviewers asking non-leading questions
- Peer audience context (NACDA/NCAA conventions) = authentic professional dialogue
- Less social desirability pressure than public announcements
- Tone and emphasis observable (not just words)

**Written Articles (Bjork, Cunningham) - MODERATE CREDIBILITY:**
- Public announcement context creates high social desirability bias
- Journalist mediation filters practitioner voice
- Typically emphasize positive rationale, minimize risks/uncertainties
- Quantitative data often included (salary figures, buyouts)

### Geographic and Institutional Diversity Assessment

**Conference Representation:**
- MAC (Ohio - Cromer) = Mid-major
- Big Ten (Washington - Durand; Ohio State - Bjork) = Elite Power 5
- Big 12 (Kansas State - Taylor; Cincinnati - Cunningham) = Power 5 with transition cases
- **Assessment:** Good conference diversity; missing Group of 5 non-power perspectives

**Institutional Context Diversity:**
- **Extreme Stability:** Cromer (20-year coaching tenure)
- **Extreme Instability:** Durand (3 ADs in 1 year), Cunningham (3 coaches in 5 years)
- **Veteran Stability:** Taylor (20+ years as AD)
- **Elite Scale:** Bjork ($100M+ budget, 36 sports)
- **Transition Stress:** Durand (Pac-12→Big Ten), Cunningham (AAC→Big 12)
- **Assessment:** Excellent diversity prevents cherry-picking success-only stories

**Missing Perspectives:**
- No FCS or Division II/III practitioners
- No head coaches (all ADs = institutional perspective only)
- No recently failed retention cases with candid post-mortem
- Limited Olympic sports focus (revenue sports emphasized)

---

## Evidence Quality Assessment

### Consistency Across Sources

#### Strong Convergent Themes (HIGH CONFIDENCE)

1. **Coaching Turnover Creates Measurable Disruption** (3/5 explicit validation)
   - Cromer: Transfer portal "zero losses" metric demonstrates recruiting stability link
   - Durand: "Coaches are integral part of day to day" - validates coaches as primary relationship holders
   - Cunningham: "Third coach in five seasons" required "restoring identity and stability"
   - **Confidence:** HIGH - Direct X→M→Y validation from multiple independent sources

2. **Culture Preservation Critical** (4/5 practitioners emphasize)
   - Cromer: "continuity and loyalty"; "going through transition together bonds you"
   - Durand: "relentlessly committed to our culture" during chaos
   - Taylor: "patience" and organizational values
   - Cunningham: "restoring identity" as explicit goal
   - **Confidence:** VERY HIGH - Convergence across stability AND instability contexts

3. **Proactive Planning Superior to Reactive** (4/5 practitioners)
   - Cromer: Succession planning before 20-year tenure ended
   - Taylor: "Tough conversations" and patience rather than avoidance
   - Bjork: 4-month transition overlap time for knowledge transfer
   - Cunningham: "Fast start" extension after 2 seasons (proactive retention)
   - **Confidence:** HIGH - Consistent across different institutional contexts

4. **Financial Investment Necessary But Insufficient Alone** (3/5 address)
   - Bjork: $76M Fisher buyout failure despite massive financial commitment
   - Cunningham: $2.95M salary PLUS "restoring identity" cultural work
   - Taylor: "Tough conversations" and patience matter beyond compensation
   - **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Fisher buyout extreme case but validates principle

#### Divergent Perspectives or Emphasis Differences

1. **Proactive (Cunningham) vs. Patient (Taylor) Timing**
   - Cunningham: "Fast start" extension after 2 seasons
   - Taylor: "Being patient" with coaches over longer timeline
   - **Reconciliation:** Context-dependent - Cincinnati instability required breaking cycle quickly; Kansas State stability allows patience
   - **Assessment:** NOT true conflict; different risk management strategies for different environments

2. **Coaching vs. AD Change Impact Hierarchy**
   - Durand: Explicitly distinguishes - coaching changes affect "day to day"; AD changes strategic only
   - Bjork/Taylor: AD stability still matters for coaching stability (20+ years enables relationships)
   - **Reconciliation:** Both levels matter but COACHING CHANGES have more direct athlete impact
   - **Assessment:** Validates X→M→Y focus on COACHING turnover specifically

3. **Conference/Institutional Context Effects**
   - Cromer (MAC): Transfer portal retention as key metric
   - Bjork (Big Ten): $76M buyouts, scale-appropriate governance
   - Taylor (Big 12): Long-term patience possible with stability
   - Durand/Cunningham: Conference transitions require extra coaching stability focus
   - **Assessment:** Core principles consistent but implementation varies by resources/context

### Evidence Depth and Specificity

**STRONG Specific Evidence:**
- ✅ Cromer: "ONLY FBS with zero losses" transfer portal metric (quantitative)
- ✅ Cunningham: 125% salary increase ($1.31M → $2.95M), "third coach in five seasons" frequency data
- ✅ Bjork: $76M Fisher buyout cost, 4-month overlap timeline, $100M+ budget scale
- ✅ Taylor: 20+ years experience, contract through 2029-30 timeline
- ✅ Durand: 3 AD transitions in 1 year frequency, Pac-12→Big Ten transition

**WEAK/GENERAL Evidence:**
- ❌ Limited discussion of WHAT specific tough conversations entail (Taylor mentions concept but not details)
- ❌ Succession planning process not fully detailed (Cromer mentions it but not step-by-step)
- ❌ "Culture" and "identity" emphasized but specific cultural practices under-specified
- ❌ Minimal quantitative data on typical turnover rates, retention success rates, or program impact metrics

**Evidence-Based vs. Opinion:**
- **Evidence-backed:** Transfer portal retention (Cromer), salary data (Cunningham), buyout costs (Bjork), tenure lengths
- **Opinion/Experience-based:** Culture preservation importance, patience value, "tough conversations" necessity
- **Assessment:** Good balance - measurable outcomes validate qualitative insights

## CEBMa Module 4 Appraisal Checklist

### Systematic Appraisal Questions (Applied to Entire Practitioner Evidence Base)

#### 1. Does the practitioner have expertise in a narrow domain or activity?
**Answer:** ✅ **YES** - All 5 practitioners have narrow expertise in Division I athletic administration with specific focus on coaching relationships and retention

**Evidence:**
- All are Athletic Directors (or Deputy AD) at Division I institutions
- Direct responsibility for coaching hiring, retention, contract decisions
- Revenue sports focus (football, men's basketball) with Olympic sports context
- Narrow domain: NOT general HR or management; SPECIFIC to coaching staff retention in college athletics

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

#### 2. To what extent has the practitioner had repeated practice?
**Answer:** ✅ **YES for 4/5 practitioners**; ⚠️ **UNCLEAR for 1/5**

**Strong Repeated Practice:**
- **Gene Taylor:** 20+ years as AD = dozens of coaching decisions across multiple sports
- **Julie Cromer:** 13 head coaches across 16 sports = ongoing repeated practice
- **Kim Durand:** 3 AD transitions in 1 year = intensive (though unusual) repeated practice with instability
- **Ross Bjork:** 3 major AD roles (Ole Miss, Texas A&M, Ohio State) = repeated practice across institutions

**Unclear/Weak Repeated Practice:**
- **John Cunningham:** Article doesn't specify tenure or prior AD experience; Cincinnati's "third coach in five seasons" suggests LIMITED repeated practice with successful retention

**Confidence:** HIGH for Taylor, Cromer, Bjork; MEDIUM-HIGH for Durand; LOW for Cunningham

---

#### 3. Has the practitioner received direct and objective feedback on outcomes?
**Answer:** ✅ **YES** - All 5 practitioners have access to direct, measurable feedback

**Strong Objective Feedback:**
- **Cromer:** Transfer portal retention (0 losses) = quantitative, immediate feedback
- **Bjork:** Financial outcomes ($76M buyout) = clear, objective cost feedback
- **Cunningham:** Recruiting class results, program performance, salary investment outcomes observable
- **Taylor:** 20+ years enables observation of long-term program outcomes, contract success/failures
- **Durand:** Student-athlete retention, team performance during transitions observable

**Assessment:** All practitioners can observe whether their retention strategies worked through measurable outcomes (player retention, recruiting, performance, financial costs)

**Confidence:** HIGH - Objective feedback available across all sources

---

#### 4. Does the practitioner work in a regular and predictable environment?
**Answer:** ⚠️ **MIXED** - 3/5 YES; 2/5 NO

**Predictable Environments (Supports Expertise):**
- **Gene Taylor:** ✅ Big 12 Conference stability, long Kansas State tenure, predictable context
- **Julie Cromer:** ✅ MOSTLY - MAC Conference stable, though recent coaching transition adds variability
- **Ross Bjork:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Elite program context predictable but external pressures variable; institutional transitions add complexity

**Unpredictable Environments (Reduces Expertise per Module 4):**
- **Kim Durand:** ❌ NO - 3 AD transitions + conference realignment + coaching changes = highly unpredictable
- **John Cunningham:** ❌ NO - Conference transition (AAC→Big 12), "third coach in five seasons" organizational instability

**Module 4 Implication:** Durand and Cunningham's unpredictable environments mean their expertise may be more susceptible to cognitive biases. However, their insights on MANAGING instability remain valuable precisely because they operated in chaos.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM - Environment predictability varies significantly; affects expertise validity differently for each practitioner

---

#### 5. Have efforts been made to reduce bias (consider alternative options, get evidence first, blind assessment, falsify views, seek disagreement, play devil's advocate)?
**Answer:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Some bias reduction efforts observable, but limited

**Bias Reduction Observed:**
- ✅ **Multiple Perspectives Sought:** 5 different practitioners from different contexts prevents single-source bias
- ✅ **Divergent Cases Included:** Both stability (Cromer) AND instability (Cunningham, Durand) cases prevents cherry-picking
- ✅ **Quantitative Grounding:** Transfer portal data (Cromer), financial figures (Bjork, Cunningham) provide objective anchors
- ✅ **Acknowledges Market Realities:** Cromer "be aware of the market"; Taylor recognizes "pressure" and difficulty

**Bias Reduction NOT Observed:**
- ❌ **Limited Failure Discussion:** Minimal detailed analysis of what retention strategies DIDN'T work
- ❌ **No Devil's Advocate:** Practitioners don't actively argue against their own recommendations
- ❌ **Public Format Constraints:** Video interviews and articles don't allow falsification or challenge of claims
- ❌ **No Blind Assessment:** All practitioners aware of outcomes when discussing strategies (hindsight available)

**Assessment:** Bias reduction achieved through source DIVERSITY and TRIANGULATION rather than individual practitioner critical thinking efforts. Interview/article formats don't encourage active falsification.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM - Some bias mitigation through research design; limited practitioner-level bias reduction

---

#### 6. Are there signs that the practitioner is subject to cognitive biases?
**Answer:** ✅ **YES** - Multiple cognitive biases detected across all practitioners

**Widespread Biases:**
- **Outcome Bias:** ALL practitioners judge strategies partly by results achieved, not just decision process quality
- **Social Desirability Bias:** Bjork and Cunningham (public announcements) have VERY HIGH risk; Cromer/Durand/Taylor (video interviews) have MEDIUM risk
- **Availability Bias:** Recent experiences highly salient (Cromer's recent transition, Durand's 3 ADs, Cunningham's "fast start")
- **Confirmation Bias:** Practitioners may selectively recall evidence supporting their preferred retention approaches

**Practitioner-Specific High-Risk Biases:**
- Cromer: Outcome bias (zero portal losses success)
- Durand: Group conformity (3 bosses in 1 year)
- Taylor: Overconfidence bias (20+ years experience)
- Bjork: Hindsight bias, Authority bias
- Cunningham: Patternicity (2 seasons may be insufficient to establish causal patterns)

**Module 4 Teaching:** "Less these four conditions are met, the more likely it is that expertise is affected by cognitive biases." Durand and Cunningham fail predictable environment criterion → HIGHER bias susceptibility.

**Confidence:** HIGH - Cognitive biases clearly present; documented for each source in individual assessments

---

#### 7. Have sound methods for acquiring evidence from practitioners been used?
**Answer:** ✅ **YES** - Sound acquisition methods with appropriate limitations acknowledged

**Strong Methodological Elements:**
- ✅ **Published Sources:** Athletic Director U (professional platform), Sports Business Journal, The Athletic (credible journalism)
- ✅ **Non-Leading Questions:** Athletic Director U interviewers use open-ended prompts, not researcher-designed leading questions
- ✅ **Peer Audience Context:** Video interviews at NACDA/NCAA conventions = professional authenticity
- ✅ **Diversity Strategy:** Intentionally sought both stability and instability cases, different conferences, experience levels
- ✅ **Verification Available:** Video and article sources provide permanent record for quote verification
- ✅ **Bias Mitigation:** Multiple independent sources, triangulation, acknowledgment of limitations

**Methodological Limitations Acknowledged:**
- ❌ No direct practitioner interviews conducted (relied on published sources only)
- ❌ All sources are ADs (no head coach direct voice)
- ❌ Article sources are public announcements with social desirability bias risk
- ❌ No failed retention cases with candid post-mortem
- ❌ Limited quantitative systematic data beyond individual examples

**Assessment:** Methods are sound for published source analysis; limitations appropriately documented in evidence-practitioner-methods.txt

**Confidence:** HIGH - Acquisition methods follow CEBMa Module 3 principles with transparency about constraints

## Overall Appraisal Summary

### Aggregate Credibility Assessment

**HIGHEST CREDIBILITY SOURCES:**
1. **Gene Taylor** (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) - All 4 Module 4 criteria met; 20+ years repeated practice; acknowledges difficulty
2. **Julie Cromer** (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) - All 4 criteria met; quantitative outcome data (transfer portal); market awareness

**HIGH CREDIBILITY SOURCES:**
3. **Kim Durand** (⭐⭐⭐⭐) - 3/4 criteria met; valuable instability management insights despite unpredictable environment
4. **Ross Bjork** (⭐⭐⭐⭐) - 3/4 criteria met; strong financial objectivity; public announcement format limits candor

**MODERATE CREDIBILITY SOURCE:**
5. **John Cunningham** (⭐⭐⭐) - 2/4 criteria met; valuable X→M→Y validation; limited retention expertise; very high social desirability bias

### Confidence Levels by Recommendation Type

**HIGH CONFIDENCE (4-5 practitioners converge; strong expertise validity; measurable outcomes):**
- Culture preservation and continuity as retention strategies
- Coaching turnover directly disrupts recruiting and program stability (X→M validation)
- Proactive succession planning superior to reactive crisis management
- Coaches are primary relationship holders for athletes (vs. ADs at strategic level)

**MEDIUM-HIGH CONFIDENCE (3-4 practitioners; good expertise validity; some measurement):**
- Financial investment necessary but insufficient alone for retention
- AD stability enables coaching stability (but coaching changes more directly impactful)
- Transfer portal retention as measurable coaching transition success metric
- "Tough conversations" and patience as retention tools

**MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (2-3 practitioners; variable expertise; limited measurement):**
- Optimal extension timing (proactive "fast start" vs. patient longer-term varies by context)
- Specific cultural practices that preserve identity during transitions
- Conference transition periods require extra coaching stability focus

**LOW-MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (1-2 practitioners; weak expertise or high bias; minimal measurement):**
- Optimal contract lengths and specific compensation structures
- Generalizability beyond practitioner's specific context (mid-major vs. elite, stable vs. unstable)
- Long-term effectiveness of specific retention interventions (outcomes still unfolding for some sources)

## Integration Recommendations

### Use Practitioner Evidence To:
✅ **Validate X→M→Y Hypothesis:** Strong convergent validation from Cromer, Durand, Cunningham that coaching turnover disrupts recruiting/stability  
✅ **Identify Retention Strategies:** Culture preservation, succession planning, proactive communication, patience consistently endorsed  
✅ **Understand Implementation Context:** Practitioners provide reality check on institutional constraints, political dynamics, resource requirements  
✅ **Prioritize Interventions:** Coaching relationship continuity prioritized over administrative stability per Durand's insight  
✅ **Define Success Metrics:** Transfer portal retention (Cromer) offers concrete measurable outcome beyond win-loss records

### Do NOT Use Practitioner Evidence To:
❌ **Establish Causality:** Practitioner evidence validates problem but cannot prove X→M→Y causal mechanism (need scientific evidence)  
❌ **Quantify Turnover Rates:** Limited systematic data; need organizational evidence (EADA, NCAA data) for frequencies  
❌ **Generalize Across All Contexts:** Strong context effects (mid-major vs. elite, stable vs. unstable) limit universal applicability  
❌ **Determine Optimal Financial Investments:** Practitioners provide examples ($2.95M, $76M) but not systematic cost-benefit analysis  
❌ **Substitute for Stakeholder Voice:** ADs provide institutional perspective; need coach and athlete voices for complete picture

### Combine With:
- **Scientific Evidence:** To validate causal mechanisms, quantify effect sizes, test hypothesized relationships
- **Organizational Evidence:** To quantify turnover rates, tenure patterns, performance correlations at scale
- **Stakeholder Evidence:** To understand coach and athlete perspectives on retention factors (not just AD institutional view)
