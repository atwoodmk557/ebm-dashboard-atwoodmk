Respondents: 376 NCAA Division I leaders
Response Rate: 26% (1,443 invited)

SURVEY FINDINGS: TRANSFER PORTAL IMPACT (LINKED TO COACHING INSTABILITY)

Q: "What impact has the transfer portal had on Division I athletics?"
- NEGATIVE impact: 86% of respondents
- POSITIVE impact: 7% of respondents
- UNSURE: 7% of respondents

KEY FINDING: "Nine in ten say the transfer portal is harming Division I athletics" 
- Jason Husser, Director, Elon University Poll

Q: "Should NCAA allow athletes to transfer unlimited times with immediate eligibility?"
- OPPOSE: 84% of respondents
- SUPPORT: 10% of respondents
- UNSURE: 6% of respondents

Q: "Should NCAA enforce strong penalties for tampering?"
- SUPPORT: 94% of respondents
- OPPOSE: 3% of respondents
- UNSURE: 3% of respondents

STAKEHOLDER INTERPRETATION:
Transfer portal is DIRECTLY LINKED to coaching instability. When coaches turnover:
- New coaches recruit through portal (increase in transfers)
- Existing players leave for better situations (increase in transfers)
- 86% of D-I leaders say this pattern is HARMFUL to Division I athletics
- 94% want stronger penalties (suggests current instability is unacceptable)

SURVEY FINDINGS: FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY CONCERNS

Q: "What direction is Division I athletics headed?"
- NEGATIVE direction: 62% of all respondents
- POSITIVE direction: 9% of all respondents
- UNSURE: 28% of all respondents

By Stakeholder Group:
- Presidents/Chancellors saying NEGATIVE: Higher than average
- Athletic Directors saying NEGATIVE: 55%
- Overall consensus: D-I structure is NOT sustainable

Q: "Concerns about reliance on institutional funds and student fees?"
- Presidents/Chancellors concerned: 86%
- Athletic Directors concerned: 80%
- Overall concern level: Very HIGH

Q: "Concerns about sustaining competitive classification level?"
- FBS leaders concerned: 48%
- Non-FBS leaders concerned: 60%
- Interpretation: Coaching buyouts/salaries contribute to unsustainable spending

COACHING TURNOVER FINANCIAL IMPACT (Knight Commission Context):
Knight Commission Nov 18, 2025 update on "FBS Football Coaching Severance Resource"
- Documents coaching buyout costs across FBS conferences
- Connects to financial sustainability concerns expressed by 86% of presidents, 80% of ADs
- Stakeholder perspective: Coaching turnover is financially HARMFUL (buyouts drain budgets)

SURVEY FINDINGS: HOUSE SETTLEMENT IMPACT (RESOURCE CONSTRAINT CONTEXT)

Q: "What impact will House v. NCAA settlement have on various sports?"
- Division I sports overall: 76% NEGATIVE, 8% POSITIVE
- Women's sports: 72% NEGATIVE, 7% POSITIVE
- Men's Olympic sports: 73% NEGATIVE, 5% POSITIVE
- Football: 40% NEGATIVE, 36% POSITIVE
- Men's basketball: 35% NEGATIVE, 37% POSITIVE

STAKEHOLDER INTERPRETATION:
Resource scarcity makes coaching decisions MORE CRITICAL:
- 72-73% say women's/Olympic sports will be harmed (resource reallocation)
- Coaching stability/turnover decisions now have HIGHER stakes
- BAD coaching hire = wasted resources in zero-sum environment
- GOOD coaching retention = protection against resource drain

SURVEY FINDINGS: DIVISION I STRUCTURE VIABILITY

Q: "The Division I structure continues to be viable"
- DISAGREE: 62% of all D-I leaders
- AGREE: 21%
- UNSURE: 17%

By Stakeholder Group:
- Presidents/Chancellors DISAGREE: 69%
- Athletic Directors DISAGREE: 55%
- Faculty Reps DISAGREE: Higher than average

STAKEHOLDER INTERPRETATION:
Leaders believe CURRENT MODEL is failing. Coaching turnover patterns (frequent firings, huge buyouts, roster instability through portal) are symptoms of broken structure.

SURVEY FINDINGS: ACADEMIC MISSION (VALUES CONTEXT)

Q: "How important is it for student-athletes to be enrolled full-time taking classes?"
- IMPORTANT: 98% of respondents

Q: "How important is it for student-athletes to graduate?"
- IMPORTANT: 99% of respondents

Q: "Should teams graduate at least 50% of athletes for postseason eligibility?"
- SUPPORT: 95% of respondents

STAKEHOLDER INTERPRETATION:
Coaching turnover affects ACADEMIC outcomes (transfer students lose credits, coaching changes disrupt academic support). Stakeholders value academic mission (98-99%), so coaching instability threatens core values.

STAKEHOLDER QUOTES FROM SURVEY RELEASE

Amy Privette Perko, CEO, Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics:
"It's a new era in college sports, and the candid views of Division I leaders suggest this new era could be a troubling one that could harm women's and collegiate Olympic sports even as the biggest football and basketball programs continue to benefit from the heightened investment and focus on their sports."

Len Elmore, Co-Chair, Knight Commission:
"This survey presents a clear picture of a defining moment in college sports. Division I is at a crossroads."

Pam Bernard, Co-Chair, Knight Commission:
"The leaders share widespread agreement that the current framework of Division I faces an unprecedented crisis of stability and sustainability. The survey also reveals that leaders support multiple potential directions for the future."

Peter Roby, Knight Commission Member:
"It is notable that 7 in 10 leaders support some type of spending limits going forward."

SOURCE 2: 247SPORTS TRANSFER PORTAL DATABASE - IOWA STATE CASE STUDY
========================================

DATA SOURCE: 247Sports.com Transfer Portal Tracking Database
URL: https://247sports.com/college/iowa-state/Season/2016-Football/TransferPortal/
Institution: Iowa State University
Sport: Football
Season: 2016 (Matt Campbell's first year after Paul Rhoads)
Data Type: Player movement tracking (incoming transfers, outgoing transfers)

COACHING TRANSITION CONTEXT:
- Paul Rhoads: Iowa State head coach 2009-2015 (fired after poor performance)
- Matt Campbell: Hired as new head coach November 2015
- 2016 Season: Campbell's first year (coaching turnover year)

TRANSFER PORTAL DATA - 2016 IOWA STATE FOOTBALL:
- INCOMING Transfers: 0 players
- OUTGOING Transfers: 0 players
- Total Portal Activity: 0 player movements

STAKEHOLDER INTERPRETATION (Student-Athletes as Low-Power Stakeholders):

Expected Pattern (typical coaching change):
- Players recruited by OLD coach transfer OUT (don't fit new system)
- New coach recruits transfers IN (quick roster rebuild)
- High portal activity = roster instability

Iowa State 2016 Actual Pattern:
- ZERO transfers in either direction
- Student-athletes STAYED despite coaching change
- Roster stability despite leadership transition

Why This Matters (Stakeholder Perspective):
- Student-athletes (low-power stakeholders) can "vote with their feet" via transfer portal
- 0 transfers = stakeholder APPROVAL of coaching hire (behavioral evidence)
- Contrast: High transfers after coaching change = stakeholder REJECTION

This supports hire QUALITY matters more than stability:
- Matt Campbell was GOOD hire → student-athletes stayed → program improved (8-5 in 2017, 8-5 in 2018, 7-6 in 2019)
- Bad hire would likely → student-athletes leave → program continues declining

LIMITATION: Iowa State is ONE case study (limited generalizability)

❌ Coaching Staff (no coach interviews obtained)
❌ Fans/Public (no systematic sentiment analysis)

PRACTICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Who can BLOCK or INFLUENCE coaching decisions?
1. Presidents/Chancellors: YES - Control budgets, can veto hires if financially unsustainable
   - 86% concerned about finances → LIKELY to block expensive hires/buyouts
   
2. Athletic Directors: YES - Direct hiring/firing authority
   - 80% concerned about finances → LIKELY to prioritize cost-effective decisions
   - Quote from Ross Bjork context: $76M buyouts creates pressure to reduce turnover

3. Faculty Reps: SOMEWHAT - Can raise academic concerns, influence policy
   - 98-99% value academic mission → Can block if coaching turnover harms academics

4. Student-Athletes: LIMITED - Can transfer (indirect power), but no direct hiring influence
   - ISU 2016: 0 transfers = stakeholder approval (but couldn't have blocked hire)

CONCLUSION: HIGH POWER stakeholders (presidents, ADs) WILL act on concerns.
86% + 80% concern levels = VERY HIGH likelihood of policy changes on coaching turnover/buyouts

ETHICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Who is HARMED by coaching instability?
1. Women's Sports Athletes: 72% of leaders say they'll be harmed by resource constraints
   - Coaching turnover + buyouts = budget cuts to women's programs

2. Olympic Sports Athletes: 73% say they'll be harmed
   - Non-revenue sports vulnerable when coaching buyouts drain budgets
   - Ethical violation: Opportunity loss, program elimination
