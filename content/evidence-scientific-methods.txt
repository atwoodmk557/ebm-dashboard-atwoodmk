SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE - ACQUISITION METHODS
==========================================

**Research Question:** Does coaching turnover in college athletics lead to recruiting disruption and performance decline?

**Xâ†’Mâ†’Y Hypothesis Framework:**
- X (Independent Variable): Coaching turnover/instability
- M (Mediator): Recruiting disruption/quality
- Y (Dependent Variable): Team performance/outcomes

## SEARCH STRATEGY

### Databases Searched
- **Google Scholar** - Multidisciplinary academic search engine
- **EBSCO SPORTDiscus (via JMU Library)** - Primary database for sports research

### Boolean Search Queries

**Query 1 (Xâ†’Y Direct Effect):**
```
("coaching turnover" OR "coaching change" OR "coach* stability") AND 
("team performance" OR "winning percentage" OR "competitive success") AND 
(college OR NCAA OR university)
```

**Query 2 (Xâ†’M Recruiting Disruption):**
```
("coaching turnover" OR "coaching change") AND 
(recruiting OR recruitment OR "talent acquisition") AND 
(sport* OR athletic*) AND (college OR NCAA)
```

**Query 3 (Meta-analyses/Reviews):**
```
("systematic review" OR "meta-analysis") AND 
(coaching OR leadership) AND (turnover OR change OR stability) AND 
(sport* OR athletic*)
```

## CONFIRMED STUDIES (n = 3)

### Study 1: Coaching Transition and Nature of Change (Johnson, Elam, & Matz, 2024)
- **Journal:** Journal of Intercollegiate Sport, Vol. 17, No. 2
- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.17161/jis.v17i2.21131
- **Design:** Cross-sectional correlational study with binary logistic regression
- **Sample:** n = 414 NCAA Division I coaching changes (2010-2020)
- **Effect Sizes:**
  * Program wins â†’ Nature of change: **r = .18, p < .01** (strongest)
  * Nagelkerke RÂ² = .146 (14.6% variance explained)
- **Key Finding:** 53.9% of coaching changes were negative (fired after poor performance); mean tenure only 4 years
- **Relevance:** Xâ†’Y relationship; recent data (2010-2020); large sample; controls for confounders

### Study 2: The Influence of Football Head Coaching Change on APR (Johnson, Pierce, et al., 2015)
- **Journal:** Journal of Sport Behavior, Vol. 38, No. 1, pp. 26-51
- **Design:** Longitudinal analysis with regression modeling
- **Sample:** FCS Division I football programs, 8-year period
- **Effect Sizes:**
  * Average APR â†’ APR in coaching change year: **r = .65, p < .01** (LARGE effect)
  * Regression coefficient: **B = .51** (APR drops ~50% during coaching change years)
- **Key Finding:** 84.17% of changes were negative; APR scores significantly lower during coaching change years
- **Relevance:** Xâ†’Y relationship; uses Academic Progress Rate (APR); longitudinal design; strongest effect size

### Study 3: Managerial Change, Longevity, and Organizational Effectiveness (Eitzen & Yetman, 1972)
- **Journal:** Administrative Science Quarterly, Vol. 17, No. 1, pp. 110-116
- **Design:** Longitudinal correlational analysis with comparison groups
- **Sample:** n = 129 NCAA college basketball teams, 657 coaching changes (1930-1970, 40 years)
- **Effect Sizes:**
  * Turnover rate â†” Winning %: **r = -0.28** (1960-1969 decade)
  * Coaching longevity effects: Gamma = .40
- **Key Finding:** "Coaching shifts do not affect performance" (regression to mean); coaching stability optimal at 10-12 years; decline after 13+ years
- **Relevance:** Xâ†’Y relationship; 2,114 year-to-year comparison observations control for regression to mean; top-tier management journal; foundational study

## EXCLUDED STUDIES

**Shipherd, Wakefield, & Filho (2018)** - Int'l Journal of Sports Science & Coaching
- **Reason:** Qualitative study, no effect sizes

**Foroughi et al. (2018)** - International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching
- **Reason:** National teams (not NCAA college athletics)

---

## SEARCH NOTES

**Evidence Gaps Identified:**
- No studies directly measure **recruiting disruption** (M variable in Xâ†’Mâ†’Y model)
- All studies measure direct Xâ†’Y effects (coaching turnover â†’ performance)
- Need to triangulate with practitioner evidence (AD interviews) for recruiting mechanisms

**Search Strategy Modifications:**
- Added "correlation", "regression", "effect size" to filter out qualitative studies
- Excluded national team studies - must be NCAA/college context

**Overall Evidence Quality:**
- 3 quantitative studies with effect sizes (r = .18 to .65 range)
- Mix of recent (2024, 2015) and foundational (1972) research
- Convergent evidence: All show coaching turnover associated with performance decline
- Study designs: Cross-sectional, longitudinal, and quasi-experimental with comparison groups

## AI ASSISTANCE DOCUMENTATION

This search strategy was developed with GitHub Copilot assistance. The AI helped with:
- Formulating Boolean search queries for academic databases
- Identifying relevant inclusion/exclusion criteria for study selection
- Screening abstracts to distinguish quantitative from qualitative studies
- Extracting effect sizes and key findings from confirmed studies

**Critical appraisal completed independently by student using CAT Manager app (CEBMa Module 7).**

All final decisions about study selection, quality assessment, and evidence interpretation were made by the student.
