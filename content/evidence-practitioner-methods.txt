# Practitioner Evidence: Methods & Acquisition Strategy
# ACTUAL METHODS USED - Documentation of how practitioner evidence was acquired

## Practitioner Evidence Goals

**Primary Goal:** Understand practitioner perspectives on coaching turnover patterns in Division I revenue sports, including root causes, organizational consequences, and retention strategies.

**Secondary Goal:** Identify proven retention strategies from experienced athletic administrators, including critical success factors and common implementation pitfalls, with direct validation of the X→M→Y hypothesis (coaching turnover → recruiting disruption → performance decline).

---

## ACTUAL ACQUISITION METHODS USED

### Method 1: Published Video Interviews (Athletic Director U)

**Platform:** Athletic Director U (https://athleticdirectoru.com/)

**Rationale for Selection:** Athletic Director U provides authentic, practitioner-led video interviews with sitting Athletic Directors discussing real challenges and strategies. These interviews offer direct practitioner voice without researcher-induced bias from question framing. Video format allows observation of emphasis and conviction behind statements.

**Search Strategy:**
- Used targeted Google searches: `site:athleticdirectoru.com "coaching" OR "retention" OR "transition" OR "stability"`
- Browsed Athletic Director U website sections: Leadership, Competitive Excellence, Staff Management
- Prioritized interviews from 2024-2025 NCAA and NACDA conventions (most recent practitioner perspectives)
- Looked for ADs discussing coaching transitions, staff retention, program stability, and culture building

**Selection Criteria for Videos:**
1. Athletic Director or Deputy AD at Division I institution (FBS/FCS)
2. Direct discussion of coaching relationships, transitions, or retention challenges
3. Conference diversity (MAC, Big Ten, Big 12, etc.)
4. Institutional stability context diversity (stable vs. high-turnover environments)
5. Revenue sport relevance (football, basketball primary but Olympic sports context acceptable)
6. Video quality adequate for quote extraction
7. Indexed timestamps available for efficient review (not required to watch full 27+ minute interviews)

**Videos Selected:**

1. **Julie Cromer, Ohio University Athletic Director**
   - URL: https://athleticdirectoru.com/julie-cromer-ohio-university-2025-ncaa-convention-one-on-one-interviews/
   - Length: 27:54 minutes
   - Key timestamps reviewed: 0:38, 2:40, 4:30, 9:48
   - Selection rationale: EXTREME STABILITY case (20-year coaching tenure in football); provides contrast to turnover cases; measurable outcome data (transfer portal "zero losses"); succession planning insights

2. **Kim Durand, University of Washington Deputy AD/SWA**
   - URL: https://athleticdirectoru.com/kim-durand-university-of-washington-2024-nacda-convention-one-on-one-interviews/
   - Length: 16:14 minutes
   - Key timestamps reviewed: 0:39, 3:03, 6:02
   - Selection rationale: EXTREME INSTABILITY case (3 AD transitions + conference realignment in 1 year); culture preservation under chaos; explicit distinction between AD changes vs. coaching changes

3. **Gene Taylor, Kansas State University Athletic Director**
   - URL: https://athleticdirectoru.com/gene-taylor-kansas-state-university-2024-nacda-convention-one-on-one-interviews/
   - Length: 16:14 minutes
   - Key timestamp reviewed: 7:19
   - Selection rationale: VETERAN PERSPECTIVE (20+ years as AD); long-term pattern recognition; emphasis on patience and "tough conversations"; Power 5 context

**Video Review Process:**
- Used Athletic Director U indexed timestamps to identify relevant discussion segments (avoided watching full videos when descriptions indicated off-topic sections)
- Watched key segments 2-3 times to ensure accurate quote capture
- Documented direct quotes with exact timestamps for verification
- Noted vocal emphasis, tone, and conviction level (video advantage over written sources)
- Created notes in QUICK_CAPTURE_TEMPLATE.md for efficient documentation
- Cross-referenced multiple segments within same interview to understand full context

**Advantages of This Method:**
- Authentic practitioner voice (not filtered through journalist interpretation)
- Direct quotes with video verification available
- Non-leading questions from Athletic Director U interviewers
- Practitioners speaking to peer audience (NACDA/NCAA conventions) = professional credibility
- Timestamps enable efficient review (2-minute key segments vs. 27-minute full videos)

**Limitations of This Method:**
- All sources are Athletic Directors (no head coach direct voice)
- Interview setting may create social desirability bias (emphasizing positives)
- Video format time-intensive compared to reading articles
- Limited diversity (all sources from Athletic Director U platform)

---

### Method 2: Published Articles with Direct AD Quotes

**Rationale for Selection:** To supplement video interviews with additional AD perspectives from different contexts, particularly ADs facing major transitions or making high-profile retention decisions. Articles from Sports Business Journal and The Athletic provide professional journalism quality with direct practitioner quotes.

**Search Strategy:**
- Google searches: `site:sportsbusinessjournal.com "athletic director" coach retention contract extension 2024 OR 2025`
- Google searches: `site:theathletic.com "athletic director" OR "head coach" contract extension recruiting stability 2024 OR 2025`
- Focused on articles about AD transitions or coaching contract extensions (retention decisions)
- Prioritized articles with DIRECT AD QUOTES (not journalist analysis alone)

**Article Selection Criteria:**
1. Must contain DIRECT QUOTES from Athletic Director or equivalent
2. AD discussing coaching retention, transitions, or stability challenges
3. Specific institutional context (not generic industry commentary)
4. Published within last 3 years (2022-2025) for current relevance
5. Credible publication (Sports Business Journal, The Athletic preferred over opinion blogs)

**Articles Selected:**

1. **Ross Bjork, Ohio State University Athletic Director**
   - Source: Sports Business Journal
   - Title: "Ohio State's Ross Bjork faces lengthy to-do list during transition period"
   - URL: https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2024/01/18/ohio-state-ross-bjork-transition-period/
   - Date: January 18, 2024
   - Selection rationale: TRANSITION PERSPECTIVE (AD moving from Texas A&M to Ohio State); direct experience with most expensive coaching buyout in history (Jimbo Fisher $76M); overlapping AD transition period strategy; elite program context ($100M+ budget)
   - Key practitioner insights: Leadership overlap importance, Jimbo Fisher buyout consequences, scale-appropriate governance

2. **John Cunningham, University of Cincinnati Athletic Director**
   - Source: The Athletic
   - Title: "Cincinnati to reward Wes Miller with contract extension after fast start"
   - URL: https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3999952/2022/12/14/cincinnati-wes-miller-extension/
   - Date: December 14, 2022
   - Selection rationale: INSTABILITY-TO-STABILITY case ("third head coach in five seasons"); proactive retention decision; conference transition context (AAC to Big 12); explicit discussion of "restoring identity and stability"; quantified financial investment (125% salary increase)
   - Key practitioner insights: Breaking turnover cycles, retention timing ("fast start"), culture restoration, conference transition challenges

**Article Review Process:**
- Used fetch_webpage tool to extract full article text
- Identified direct AD quotes vs. journalist interpretation/analysis
- Documented specific practitioner statements about problem recognition and solutions
- Noted contextual factors (conference transitions, institutional history, financial details)
- Assessed whether article was PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT (with social desirability bias risk) vs. candid interview

**Articles Rejected and Why:**
- **The Athletic Hot Seat Rankings (Oct 2022):** Journalist Bruce Feldman analysis WITHOUT direct AD/coach quotes = NOT practitioner evidence
- **SBJ Closing Bell (Oct 2025):** News briefs without direct practitioner quotes
- **ACU Digital Commons PDF:** Inaccessible; likely academic thesis (would be scientific evidence, not practitioner)

**Advantages of This Method:**
- Access to ADs at elite programs (Ohio State, Cincinnati) who may be less available for direct interviews
- Quantitative data included (buyout amounts, salary figures, contract lengths)
- Different institutional contexts than video sources
- Permanent written record with URL citations

**Limitations of This Method:**
- Public announcement context creates social desirability bias risk
- Journalist mediation filters practitioner voice (quotes selected by journalist, not researcher)
- Limited depth compared to full interviews (shorter quotes, less context)
- May miss nuance visible in video interviews (tone, emphasis, body language)

## DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY USED

### QUICK_CAPTURE_TEMPLATE.md System

**Purpose:** Efficient capture of video interview insights without requiring full 27-minute video viewing

**Template Structure Created:**
1. **Video Priority Rankings** - Rated each video ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (BEST) to ⭐⭐ (MODERATE) based on relevance to coaching turnover/retention
2. **Indexed Timestamps** - Listed specific timestamps from Athletic Director U descriptions indicating when coaching/retention topics discussed
3. **Quick Notes Section** - Space for capturing direct quotes, key themes, and insights during viewing
4. **Efficiency Features** - Allowed 2-3 minute targeted viewing vs. 27-minute full watch; enabled rapid review of 5 sources

**Handwritten Notes Captured (from video viewing):**

**Julie Cromer (Ohio AD):**
- "for any coach, for any AD, any sport going through that transition together bonds you" (0:38)
- "I think you have to be aware of the possibility and the market" (2:40)
- Transfer portal: "ONLY FBS with zero losses" during coaching transition (4:30)

## QUALITY ASSURANCE MEASURES

### Selection Bias Avoidance

**Intentional Diversity Strategy:**
- Sought BOTH stability cases (Cromer 20-year tenure) AND instability cases (Cunningham 3 coaches in 5 years)
- Included BOTH mid-major (MAC) AND elite programs (Big Ten, Big 12)
- Included BOTH veteran ADs (Taylor 20+ years) AND newer contexts (Durand navigating transitions)
- Included conference transition perspectives (Durand Pac-12→Big Ten, Cunningham AAC→Big 12)

**Avoided Cherry-Picking:**
- Did NOT select only practitioners with successful retention outcomes
- Included Bjork's Fisher buyout failure ($76M consequence of failed retention/performance)
- Included Cunningham's explicit statement about instability ("third coach in five seasons")
- Durand's extreme instability context (3 AD transitions) provides non-success perspective

**Search Strategy Neutrality:**
- Used broad search terms ("coaching", "retention", "transition", "stability") not loaded terms ("success", "best practices only")
- Reviewed multiple Athletic Director U videos beyond those ultimately selected
- Rejected sources lacking direct practitioner quotes (Hot Seat article) even when content relevant

### Question Quality Assessment (for video sources)

**Athletic Director U Interview Strengths:**
- Non-leading questions from professional interviewers
- Open-ended prompts allowing practitioners to frame issues in own words
- Peer audience context (AD speaking to other ADs at conventions) = professional credibility
- Not researcher-designed questions (reduces researcher bias in question framing)

**Limitations Noted:**
- Interview setting (NACDA/NCAA conventions) may create social desirability bias
- Public professional context may limit candid discussion of failures
- No follow-up questions available to probe specific claims
- Cannot ask clarifying questions tailored to research needs

### Cognitive Bias Mitigation Applied

**During Acquisition:**
1. **Considered Multiple Perspectives:** Sought 5 different practitioners, not single source
2. **Avoided Confirmation Bias:** Included both stability advocates (Cromer, Taylor) and practitioners addressing instability consequences (Cunningham, Durand)
3. **Sought Divergent Views:** Explicitly looked for disagreement or different emphases (e.g., Cunningham "fast start" retention vs. Taylor "patience")
4. **Falsification Approach:** Looked for practitioners discussing FAILURES not just successes (Bjork Fisher buyout, Cunningham's "third coach in five years")

**During Analysis:**
1. **Cross-Validation:** Checked whether claims made by one practitioner supported/contradicted by others
2. **Bias Documentation:** Explicitly assessed each practitioner for outcome bias, availability bias, social desirability bias, confirmation bias, overconfidence bias
3. **Context Recognition:** Noted when practitioner's environment was UNPREDICTABLE (Durand, Cunningham) reducing expertise validity per Module 4
4. **Quantitative Grounding:** Prioritized practitioners citing measurable outcomes (Cromer "zero transfer portal losses", Cunningham 125% salary increase, Bjork $76M buyout)

## ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Use of Published Sources

**Informed Consent:** All sources are PUBLICLY AVAILABLE published interviews/articles where practitioners consented to public dissemination. No additional consent required for research use under fair use doctrine.

**Attribution:** Full attribution provided (names, titles, institutions) as practitioners made statements in professional public context. No anonymization needed as statements already public record.

**Fair Use:** Quotes used for scholarly research purposes with full citations; not reproducing entire interviews/articles; transformative use through analysis and synthesis.

**Professional Courtesy:** 
- All source URLs provided for verification
- Quotes presented in full context, not selectively edited to misrepresent
- Practitioner expertise limitations acknowledged (bias assessments conducted)
- Acknowledging when public announcement context may limit candor

---

## CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED & SOLUTIONS

### Challenge 1: Time Constraints - Full Video Viewing Not Feasible

**Problem:** Athletic Director U videos range from 16-28 minutes each; watching 5 full videos = 2+ hours

**Solution Implemented:**
- Leveraged Athletic Director U's indexed timestamps in video descriptions
- Identified 2-4 key segments per video (usually 60-120 seconds each)
- Watched only relevant segments multiple times for accuracy
- Created QUICK_CAPTURE_TEMPLATE.md with priority rankings to focus on highest-value sources first
- **Outcome:** Extracted high-quality practitioner insights in fraction of time; Julie Cromer (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) received most attention

### Challenge 2: Distinguishing Practitioner Evidence from Sports Journalism

**Problem:** Many articles ABOUT coaching turnover don't contain direct practitioner quotes (e.g., Hot Seat Rankings article)

**Solution Implemented:**
- Established clear criterion: Article must contain DIRECT AD/coach quotes about their experiences and decisions
- Rejected journalist analysis articles even when topically relevant
- Used fetch_webpage tool to extract full article text and verify direct quotes present
- Explicitly documented WHY sources rejected (transparency in selection process)
- **Outcome:** Ross Bjork and John Cunningham articles qualified (direct quotes); Hot Seat article rejected (journalist opinion)

### Challenge 3: Limited Head Coach Direct Voice

**Problem:** All 5 sources are Athletic Directors (institutional perspective); no head coach direct voice about what makes THEM stay/leave

**Solution Implemented:**
- Acknowledged this limitation explicitly in gaps analysis
- Noted that AD perspective provides INSTITUTIONAL SIDE of retention challenge
- Recognized that ADs ARE practitioners with expertise in retention (even if not coaches themselves)
- **Outcome:** Practitioner evidence strong for institutional retention strategies; would need coach interviews to fully understand coach decision-making (noted as future research direction)

### Challenge 4: Potential Social Desirability Bias in Public Interviews

**Problem:** Athletic Director U interviews conducted at professional conventions with peer audiences; practitioners may emphasize successes and downplay failures

**Solution Implemented:**
- Explicitly assessed social desirability bias risk for each source in cognitive bias section
- Sought practitioners discussing CHALLENGES not just successes (Durand's 3 AD transitions, Cunningham's instability history, Taylor's "tough conversations")
- Cross-validated claims across multiple sources
- Noted when article context (public announcement like Cunningham extension) likely to create positive framing
- **Outcome:** Bias risk acknowledged and documented; used convergence across 5 sources to increase confidence

### Challenge 5: Access to Elite Program Practitioners

**Problem:** Power 5 / elite program ADs extremely busy and unlikely to respond to cold outreach for student research

**Solution Implemented:**
- Prioritized PUBLISHED sources (Athletic Director U, Sports Business Journal, The Athletic) over direct interview attempts
- Accepted that article-based sources provide less depth but greater access to elite practitioners (Ross Bjork at Ohio State)
- Supplemented elite program perspectives (Bjork, Taylor) with accessible mid-major sources (Cromer)
- **Outcome:** Achieved conference diversity (MAC, Big 10, Big 12) without requiring direct practitioner access

---

## DEVIATIONS FROM ORIGINAL PLAN

### Original Plan Elements NOT Implemented:

1. **Direct Practitioner Interviews:** Did NOT conduct original interviews; used published sources only
   - **Rationale:** Time constraints; sufficient published sources available; published sources already vetted by Athletic Director U/SBJ/The Athletic for quality
   - **Impact:** Less ability to ask follow-up questions; BUT avoided researcher-induced bias from question framing

2. **LinkedIn Outreach:** Did NOT contact practitioners via LinkedIn
   - **Rationale:** Published sources provided sufficient practitioner diversity; cold outreach low probability of response within project timeline
   - **Impact:** Relied entirely on published sources; may miss practitioners not featured in public interviews

3. **Case Study Research from Athletic Department Documents:** Did NOT request institutional strategic plans or FOIA records
   - **Rationale:** Practitioner interviews contained sufficient case examples (Cromer's transfer portal retention, Cunningham's extension, Bjork's Fisher buyout)
   - **Impact:** Less institutional documentation; BUT practitioners provided rich qualitative insights

4. **Delphi Method / Iterative Questionnaires:** Did NOT use structured consensus-building approach
   - **Rationale:** One-time published sources don't allow iterative engagement
   - **Impact:** Cannot validate themes with practitioners; BUT synthesis across 5 sources provides internal triangulation

### Advantages of Actual Approach Used:

- **Efficiency:** Published sources accessible immediately without outreach/scheduling delays
- **Quality:** Athletic Director U interviews conducted by professional interviewers with established credibility
- **Authenticity:** Practitioners speaking to peer audiences (conventions) vs. student researcher = more candid professional dialogue
- **Bias Reduction:** Non-researcher-designed questions reduce interviewer bias
- **Verification:** Video/article sources provide permanent record for quote verification
- **Diversity Achieved:** 5 practitioners across conferences, stability contexts, experience levels without requiring direct access

## MINIMUM VIABLE EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT

### Threshold Achieved:

✅ **At least 3 practitioner voices** - Have 5 Athletic Directors representing different perspectives
✅ **At least 1 practitioner with 10+ years experience** - Gene Taylor (20+ years), Julie Cromer (5.5 years at Ohio but managing 13 coaches across 16 sports)
✅ **At least 1 practitioner with direct retention strategy implementation** - Julie Cromer (succession planning → zero transfer portal losses), John Cunningham (Wes Miller extension)
✅ **At least 2 concrete case examples** - Cromer's transfer portal retention success, Cunningham's "third coach in five seasons" instability problem, Bjork's $76M Fisher buyout
✅ **Sufficient detail to assess cognitive bias risk** - All sources include expertise validity assessment and bias evaluation

**Confidence in Evidence Quality:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- Meets all minimum thresholds
- Good diversity (5 sources across conferences and contexts)
- Measurable outcomes cited (transfer portal data, financial figures)
- Convergent validation from multiple independent sources
- Limitations acknowledged (AD-only perspective, potential social desirability bias)

## SUMMARY: ACTUAL METHODS USED

**What We Did:**
1. Identified Athletic Director U as primary practitioner source platform (video interviews)
2. Searched for relevant AD interviews about coaching retention/transitions (2024-2025 conventions)
3. Selected 3 high-priority videos (Cromer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, Durand ⭐⭐⭐⭐, Taylor ⭐⭐⭐⭐)
4. Used indexed timestamps to watch 2-minute key segments (not full 27-minute videos)
5. Captured handwritten notes with direct quotes and timestamps in QUICK_CAPTURE_TEMPLATE.md
6. Supplemented with 2 article sources containing direct AD quotes (Bjork from SBJ, Cunningham from The Athletic)
7. Applied CEBMa Module 4 expertise validity criteria to each practitioner
8. Conducted cognitive bias assessment for all sources
9. Synthesized convergent themes, divergent perspectives, and gaps
10. Connected all evidence to X→M→Y hypothesis (coaching turnover → recruiting disruption → performance decline)

**What We Didn't Do:**
- Did NOT conduct original practitioner interviews (used published sources only)
- Did NOT do LinkedIn outreach or cold contact practitioners
- Did NOT use Delphi method or iterative questionnaires
- Did NOT request institutional documents or FOIA records
- Did NOT interview head coaches directly (all sources are ADs)

**Why This Approach Worked:**
- Efficient (published sources immediately accessible)
- Credible (Athletic Director U professional platform, SBJ/The Athletic journalism standards)
- Authentic (practitioners speaking to peer audiences at conventions)
- Verifiable (video/article sources provide permanent record)
- Sufficient diversity (5 practitioners across conferences, contexts, experience levels)
- CEBMa-compliant (Module 3 & 4 frameworks applied throughout)
