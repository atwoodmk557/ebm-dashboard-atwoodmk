APPLYING THE 10 BARRIERS TO ORGANIZATIONAL DATA

===========================================================================
DATASET 1: BLS EMPLOYMENT DATA APPRAISAL
===========================================================================

BARRIER 1: NO LOGIC MODEL
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: Data collection was hypothesis-driven with clear X→Y logic model:
  X (Coaching Turnover) → Y (Performance Decline)
BLS employment data selected specifically to understand coaching profession 
stability and employment trends in educational services sector. However, BLS 
data does NOT directly measure turnover (X) or performance (Y) - it measures 
total employment levels, which is a LIMITED proxy for workforce stability.

BARRIER 2: IRRELEVANT INDICATORS  
Does it apply? PARTIALLY ⚠️ (BLS ONLY)
Severity: MODERATE for BLS, RESOLVED by Sports-Reference data
Assessment: Total employment is NOT the ideal indicator for coaching turnover.
- Wanted: Coaching job change rates, tenure duration, turnover rates
- Got (BLS): Total number of coaching jobs in economy
- Problem: Employment level can remain stable even with HIGH turnover if jobs 
  are quickly refilled. Measuring "how many coaching jobs exist" ≠ measuring 
  "how often coaches change jobs."
- **RESOLUTION: Sports-Reference data DIRECTLY measures coaching changes and 
  performance, providing exactly the X→Y indicators needed.**

BARRIER 3: LACK OF OBJECTIVITY
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: BLS uses standardized survey methodology with objective employment 
counts. No subjective judgment involved. Data collected through employer surveys 
with established protocols. High objectivity.

BARRIER 4: MISSING CONTEXT
Does it apply? NO ✅ (after analysis)
Severity: N/A
Assessment: Initially, raw numbers (306,500 coaches) lack context. Analysis 
provided context through:
- 10-year historical trend (26.2% growth)
- Industry comparison (Educational Services = 28.6%)
- Geographic comparison (Iowa vs. national average)
- Benchmark: compared to population-adjusted rates
Adequate context established for interpretation.

BARRIER 5: MEASUREMENT ERROR
Does it apply? YES, MINOR ⚠️
Severity: LOW
Assessment: BLS OEWS uses sampling methodology with inherent error:
- Relative Standard Error (RSE) provided for estimates
- National data: RSE typically <2% (high reliability)
- State data (Iowa): RSE may be 3-5% (moderate reliability)
- Educational Services sector: Large sample, low error
- Error disclosed in BLS documentation
Impact: Minimal - national trends reliable; state-level estimates have acceptable 
error margins for descriptive analysis.

BARRIER 6: SMALL NUMBER PROBLEM
Does it apply? NO ✅ (for national data)
Severity: N/A
Assessment: National sample is LARGE:
- 306,500 total coaches
- 87,600 in educational services
- Sample size adequate for reliable estimates
State-level data (Iowa: 4,590) is smaller but still sufficiently large to avoid 
distortion. No small number problem for primary analysis.

BARRIER 7: BASE RATE NEGLECT
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: All growth rates calculated with proper baselines:
- "26.2% growth" explicitly shows base year (2014: 242,900) and end year 
  (2024: 306,500)
- Absolute changes (+63,600 jobs) reported alongside percentages
- No misleading relative increases without base rates
Proper statistical reporting maintained throughout.

BARRIER 8: MISLEADING VISUALIZATION
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A  
Assessment: Analysis uses tables with clear baselines. If visualizations were 
created, they would include:
- Zero baselines on bar charts
- Clearly labeled axes
- Appropriate scales
- No truncated y-axes to exaggerate trends
No misleading visual representations used.

BARRIER 9: SPURIOUS CORRELATIONS / WEAK RELATIONSHIPS
Does it apply? NOT APPLICABLE ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: BLS data is DESCRIPTIVE only - no correlations calculated. Did NOT 
attempt to correlate employment levels with performance outcomes. 
ACKNOWLEDGED: BLS data cannot test X→Y hypothesis without performance data.
No risk of spurious correlations because no correlational analysis performed.
Appropriate restraint in claims made from data.

BARRIER 10: WIDE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS / HIGH VARIABILITY
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: BLS data shows STABLE, CONSISTENT trends:
- Steady growth across all time periods (except COVID dip)
- Low standard errors reported for estimates
- Variability within expected range for labor market data
- No wild fluctuations or unreliable estimates
Confidence intervals sufficiently narrow for descriptive conclusions.

===========================================================================
OVERALL CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
===========================================================================

Trustworthiness of BLS Data: HIGH ✅

Strengths:
✅ Objective, standardized government data collection
✅ Large sample sizes (national and state levels)
✅ 10-year longitudinal data shows reliable trends
✅ Clear methodology and documentation
✅ Low measurement error (RSE <2-5%)
✅ Proper context and baselines provided

Weaknesses:
⚠️ Does NOT measure actual coaching turnover (Barrier 2: Irrelevant Indicator)
⚠️ Employment levels ≠ job change rates
⚠️ Cannot directly test X→Y hypothesis without performance data

APPLICABILITY TO RESEARCH QUESTION:

Can BLS data answer "Does coaching turnover lead to performance decline"?
❌ NO - BLS data measures employment levels, not turnover or performance.

Can BLS data provide organizational context?
✅ YES - BLS data shows coaching profession is stable and growing, educational 
services is largest employer sector, and Iowa coaching employment aligns with 
state size.

CONCLUSION (BLS DATA):
BLS organizational data has HIGH QUALITY but LIMITED RELEVANCE to core research 
question. Data provides valuable CONTEXT about coaching profession stability but 
does NOT directly measure key variables (turnover rates, performance outcomes). 

Confidence in BLS Data Quality: 85% HIGH
Confidence BLS Answers Research Question: 25% LOW (wrong variables measured)

===========================================================================
===========================================================================

DATASET 2: SPORTS-REFERENCE COACHING CHANGE DATA APPRAISAL

BARRIER 1: NO LOGIC MODEL
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: Data collection explicitly tested X→Y hypothesis:
  X (Coaching Turnover): Paul Rhoads fired after 2-10, 3-9 seasons
  Y (Performance): Matt Campbell era shows rebuild then improvement
Sports-Reference data provides DIRECT measurement of both variables with 
longitudinal tracking (2009-2025). Logic model fully operationalized.

BARRIER 2: IRRELEVANT INDICATORS
Does it apply? NO ✅✅✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: Sports-Reference data measures EXACTLY the right variables:
- X Variable: Coaching changes (Rhoads→Campbell transition documented)
- Y Variable: Team performance (win-loss records, bowl games, rankings)
- Temporal sequence: Can see performance BEFORE, DURING, AFTER turnover
- **CRITICAL FINDING: Performance declined BEFORE turnover (2.7 wins 2013-15), 
  proving turnover was RESPONSE not CAUSE. New coach improved performance 
  (7.7 wins average 2017-24).**
This is the IDEAL indicator set for testing hypothesis.

BARRIER 3: LACK OF OBJECTIVITY
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: Win-loss records are objective, verifiable facts. No subjective 
interpretation needed. Sports-Reference compiles official NCAA statistics. 
Rankings (AP Poll) have subjectivity but W-L records are pure objective data.

BARRIER 4: MISSING CONTEXT
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: Context provided through:
- Historical comparison (Rhoads 2009-2012 vs 2013-2015)
- Peer comparison (other Big 12 schools' coaching changes)
- Longitudinal tracking (16 seasons of ISU data)
- Conference performance (Big 12 records alongside overall records)
Adequate context for interpretation.

BARRIER 5: MEASUREMENT ERROR
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: Win-loss records have ZERO measurement error - games are objectively 
won or lost. No sampling, no estimation, no error range. Perfect reliability.

BARRIER 6: SMALL NUMBER PROBLEM
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: Adequate sample sizes:
- 16 seasons of ISU data (2009-2025)
- 7 seasons pre-Campbell, 9 seasons Campbell era
- 12+ games per season = ~180 total games analyzed
- Big 12 conference context (10-16 schools, 30 years)
Sample size sufficient for pattern identification.

BARRIER 7: BASE RATE NEGLECT
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: Analysis properly used baselines:
- Compared Campbell era to Rhoads era (not just absolute numbers)
- Noted historical context (ISU typically 4-8 to 7-5 range)
- Used averages (2.7 wins vs 7.7 wins) with proper baseline
No misleading percentages without context.

BARRIER 8: MISLEADING VISUALIZATION
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: Data presented in clear tables with proper scales. Win-loss records 
shown with context (bowl games, rankings). No misleading charts or truncated axes. 
Transparent presentation.

BARRIER 9: SPURIOUS CORRELATIONS / WEAK RELATIONSHIPS
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: The ISU case shows STRONG, CLEAR pattern:
- Decline (2013-2015): 3-9, 2-10, 3-9 = consistent poor performance
- Transition (2016): 3-9 expected dip
- Improvement (2017-2024): 8-5, 8-5, 7-6, 9-3, 7-6, 4-8, 7-6, 11-3
Pattern is NOT random fluctuation - sustained 7+ wins for 7 of 8 Campbell seasons.
Relationship is STRONG and temporally coherent.

BARRIER 10: WIDE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
Does it apply? NO ✅
Severity: N/A
Assessment: Win-loss records have no confidence intervals (exact counts). 
Performance trends are stable and consistent within each era. Low variability 
within Rhoads decline period (consistently bad) and Campbell success period 
(consistently 7+ wins except 2022 outlier). High reliability.

===========================================================================
OVERALL CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT - SPORTS-REFERENCE DATA
===========================================================================

Trustworthiness of Sports-Reference Data: VERY HIGH ✅✅

Strengths:
✅ Directly measures X (coaching turnover) and Y (performance)
✅ Objective win-loss records with zero measurement error
✅ Longitudinal data (16 seasons) shows clear patterns
✅ Temporal sequence preserved (can see before/during/after turnover)
✅ Proper context through historical and peer comparisons
✅ Large sample (180+ games analyzed)
✅ No spurious correlations - patterns are strong and consistent
✅ Transparent, verifiable data from official NCAA records

Weaknesses:
⚠️ Single case study (ISU) - generalizability limited
⚠️ Cannot control for other variables (recruiting, facilities, transfer portal)
⚠️ Coaching quality varies (Campbell success not guaranteed with all hires)

APPLICABILITY TO RESEARCH QUESTION:

Can Sports-Reference data answer "Does coaching turnover lead to performance decline"?
✅ YES - But with IMPORTANT NUANCE: ISU data shows performance declined FIRST, 
then turnover happened as organizational response. Turnover caused 1-year rebuild 
disruption but ultimately led to IMPROVEMENT with right hire.

FINDING: Coaching turnover is NOT simple cause of decline. Instead:
  1. Poor performance often CAUSES turnover (not other way around)
  2. Turnover creates SHORT-TERM disruption (1 rebuilding year)
  3. Long-term outcome depends on QUALITY of new hire
  4. Stability under RIGHT coach > frequent changes

CONCLUSION (SPORTS-REFERENCE DATA):
Sports-Reference organizational data has VERY HIGH QUALITY and HIGH RELEVANCE 
to research question. Data directly tests X→Y relationship with objective, 
longitudinal performance metrics. Key insight: causality is COMPLEX - turnover 
often response to existing decline, not initial cause.

Confidence in Sports-Reference Data Quality: 95% VERY HIGH
Confidence Sports-Reference Answers Research Question: 80% HIGH

===========================================================================
===========================================================================

COMBINED ORGANIZATIONAL EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT

OVERALL QUALITY: HIGH ✅
BLS data (85% quality) + Sports-Reference data (95% quality) = robust evidence base

OVERALL RELEVANCE: HIGH ✅  
BLS provides profession context (25% relevance) + Sports-Reference provides 
X→Y testing (80% relevance) = 70% overall relevance to research question

COMBINED CONCLUSION:
Organizational evidence STRONGLY supports nuanced understanding of coaching 
turnover. Sports-Reference data addresses BLS limitations by providing direct 
X→Y measurement. Combined evidence shows:

1. **Coaching profession is stable/growing** (BLS context)
2. **Turnover often follows decline, not causes it** (Sports-Reference finding)
3. **Right hire can reverse decline** (ISU Campbell case)
4. **Stability matters but quality matters more** (7.7 wins with Campbell vs 
   2.7 wins with declining Rhoads)

RECOMMENDATION:
Use BLS as industry CONTEXT and Sports-Reference as PRIMARY organizational 
evidence. Acknowledge single-case limitation but recognize pattern aligns with 
scientific evidence (Johnson 2015 FCS study showed similar patterns).

**FINAL CONFIDENCE RATINGS:**
- Combined Data Quality: 90% VERY HIGH
- Combined Research Relevance: 70% HIGH
- Confidence in Conclusions: 75% HIGH
