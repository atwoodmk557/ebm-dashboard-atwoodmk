Document Created: November 21, 2025
Project: Coaching Turnover Impact on Athletic Performance

CEBMA MODULE 11 FRAMEWORK: STAKEHOLDER EVIDENCE EVALUATION
Key Assessment Criteria:
1. REPRESENTATIVENESS: How well does sample represent whole population?
2. SELECTION BIAS: Were certain stakeholder voices systematically excluded?
3. OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS VIEWS: Could stakeholders speak freely?
4. PRACTICAL IMPACT: Can stakeholders block/influence decisions?
5. ETHICAL IMPACT: Who is harmed by the problem?
6. DEMOGRAPHIC MATCH: Do respondents match population characteristics?

========================================
OVERALL EVIDENCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT
========================================

Evidence Type: SECONDARY SOURCES ONLY (no primary data collection)
Total Data Sources: 3 verified secondary sources
Primary Source: Knight Commission/Elon Poll (376 D-I leaders surveyed)
Supporting Sources: 247Sports Transfer Portal data + 5 AD interview reanalysis

OVERALL CONFIDENCE LEVEL: MEDIUM (65%)
- Decision-maker stakeholder perspectives: STRONG (85%)
- Affected party stakeholder perspectives: WEAK (35%)
- Representative of full stakeholder landscape: PARTIAL

========================================
SOURCE 1 APPRAISAL: KNIGHT COMMISSION/ELON POLL SURVEY
========================================

DATA COLLECTION QUALITY: HIGH (90%)

Sample Representativeness: HIGH (85%)
- Target Population: All NCAA Division I institutions (363 institutions)
- Invited: 1,443 D-I leaders (approximately 4 per institution)
- Responded: 376 D-I leaders
- Response Rate: 26%
- Margin of Error: +/-4.4% at 95% confidence level

Response Rate Assessment:
✅ 26% is ABOVE AVERAGE for academic surveys of busy executives (typical: 10-20%)
✅ 376 respondents provides statistical validity for population of ~1,443
✅ Margin of error (+/-4.4%) acceptable for descriptive findings
⚠️ Potential non-response bias: May non-responders differ systematically?

Stakeholder Group Coverage:
✅ Presidents/Chancellors: Included (HIGH POWER stakeholders)
✅ Athletic Directors: Included (HIGH POWER stakeholders)
✅ Senior Woman Administrators: Included (MEDIUM POWER stakeholders)
✅ Faculty Athletics Representatives: Included (MEDIUM POWER stakeholders)
❌ Student-Athletes: NOT included (LOW POWER but HIGH INTEREST stakeholders)
❌ Coaching Staff: NOT included
❌ Donors/Boosters: NOT included (HIGH POWER but external stakeholders)

Representativeness Score: HIGH for institutional decision-makers, LOW for affected parties

Survey Methodology Quality: VERY HIGH (95%)
✅ Professional survey firm (Elon University Poll - established academic polling center)
✅ Standard online platform (Qualtrics)
✅ Appropriate survey window (July-August 2025, no major competing events)
✅ Transparent methodology (dates, sample size, MOE published)
✅ Reputable sponsor (Knight Commission - established NCAA watchdog organization)
✅ Peer-reviewed design (Knight Commission has credibility in higher ed research)

Response Quality Indicators: HIGH (85%)
✅ Survey length: Appropriate (not reported but Knight Commission surveys typically 15-20 minutes)
✅ Question clarity: Professional survey design, no leading questions evident
✅ Topic relevance: Current issues (transfer portal, House settlement, D-I viability)
⚠️ Completion rates: Not reported (cannot assess partial vs. complete responses)
⚠️ Time-on-task data: Not published (cannot verify thoughtful responses vs. speeders)

BIAS ASSESSMENT: MODERATE RISK (Multiple Bias Types Present)

Selection Bias Risk: HIGH
Issue: Only institutional stakeholders surveyed, NOT directly affected parties
Who's Included: Presidents, ADs, SWAs, Faculty Reps (decision-makers)
Who's Excluded: Student-athletes, coaches, donors, fans (affected parties + financiers)

CEBMa Module 11 Warning: "Even random samples can be unrepresentative by chance"
Application: Survey RANDOMLY sampled from D-I leadership... but leadership itself is NOT representative of all stakeholders

Bias Direction: 
- OVER-REPRESENTS: Institutional/administrative perspectives
- UNDER-REPRESENTS: Athlete/coach/external financial perspectives
- CONSEQUENCE: May prioritize institutional concerns over athlete welfare

Self-Selection Bias Risk: MODERATE
Issue: 26% response rate means 74% chose NOT to respond
Who Responded: Likely those with STRONG opinions (either very concerned OR very satisfied)
Who Didn't Respond: Potentially those with moderate views or too busy to engage
Bias Direction: Responses may be MORE EXTREME than true population (polarization effect)

Response Bias Assessment: LOW RISK
Social Desirability Bias: LOW
- Survey was ANONYMOUS (respondents could speak freely)
- Topics allow negative views (majority DID express concerns: 62% negative on D-I direction)
- No evidence of leading questions or pressure to respond positively

Acquiescence Bias: LOW  
- Survey included both agreement and disagreement options
- Results show variation (not all questions skewed one direction)
- Specific percentages vary widely by question (range: 7% to 99%)

Recency Bias: MODERATE RISK
- Survey conducted August 2025, just after House v. NCAA settlement announcement (July 2024-June 2025)
- Transfer portal concerns may be heightened by recent high-profile transfers
- Financial concerns tied to CURRENT House settlement (may not reflect long-term views)
- Coaching turnover concerns connected to recent high-profile firings (Nebraska, Michigan State, etc.)

REPRESENTATIVENESS ANALYSIS (CEBMa Module 11 Focus)

Question 1: Do respondents represent the WHOLE POPULATION of D-I stakeholders?
ANSWER: NO - Only represents DECISION-MAKER subset

Population Demographics:
- D-I Institutions: 363 schools (from FBS power conferences to FCS small conferences)
- Student-Athletes: ~180,000 D-I athletes across all sports
- Coaches: ~6,000 head coaches + ~20,000 assistant coaches
- Administrators: ~1,500 presidents, ADs, senior staff
- Donors/Boosters: Unknown number (thousands of major donors)
- Fans/Public: Millions of stakeholders with interest but no power

Survey Demographics:
- Surveyed: 376 administrators (presidents, ADs, SWAs, faculty reps)
- Percentage of total stakeholders: <0.2% if including athletes, coaches, donors
- Stakeholder power representation: HIGH POWER stakeholders well-represented, LOW POWER missing

Demographic Match Assessment: POOR (30%)
✅ Geographic diversity: Likely (all D-I conferences invited)
✅ Institution type diversity: Likely (FBS and non-FBS breakdown reported)
✅ Gender diversity: Partially (SWAs included, but likely male-dominated overall)
❌ Role diversity: POOR (only administrators, no athletes/coaches)
❌ Power diversity: POOR (only high/medium power, no low power voices)
❌ Perspective diversity: POOR (institutional view only, not affected party view)

Question 2: Did stakeholders have opportunity to FREELY EXPRESS views?
ANSWER: YES for those surveyed, but survey didn't include all stakeholder groups

Survey Design for Free Expression:
✅ Anonymous responses (no name/institution tracking reported publicly)
✅ Independent polling organization (Elon, not NCAA - reduces institutional pressure)
✅ Open-ended options available (quotes suggest qualitative responses collected)
✅ Results show negative views expressed (62% say D-I headed negative direction)

Limitation: Student-athletes may face retaliation risk if surveyed (NCAA eligibility concerns, team dynamics)
Limitation: Coaches may face job security pressure if openly critical of athletic directors

Question 3: Are there SELECTION BIAS concerns that undermine validity?
ANSWER: YES - Significant selection bias toward HIGH POWER institutional stakeholders

Selection Bias Type 1: Stakeholder Group Exclusion
- Student-athletes: EXCLUDED (directly affected by coaching turnover, no voice)
- Coaches: EXCLUDED (job security directly at stake, no voice)
- Donors: EXCLUDED (financial power to influence decisions, no voice)
→ CONSEQUENCE: Survey captures concerns of those who MAKE decisions, not those AFFECTED by decisions

Selection Bias Type 2: Non-Response Bias
- 74% of invited leaders did NOT respond
- Possible reasons: Too busy, no strong opinion, uncomfortable with topic, survey fatigue
- Concern: Do the 26% who responded differ from 74% who didn't?
- Mitigation: Large absolute N (376) provides statistical power despite low response rate

Selection Bias Type 3: Institutional Type Bias
- FBS power conference schools: Likely over-represented (more resources, more engaged with Knight Commission)
- Small D-I non-FBS schools: Possibly under-represented (less staff capacity, different priorities)
- Evidence: 48% of FBS leaders concerned about classification vs. 60% non-FBS (suggests both included but proportions unclear)

CEBMa Module 11 Assessment: "Primary quality indicator is REPRESENTATIVENESS"
VERDICT: Sample is representative of D-I LEADERSHIP, NOT representative of D-I STAKEHOLDERS overall
CONFIDENCE for decision-maker views: HIGH (85%)
CONFIDENCE for full stakeholder landscape: LOW (40%)

PRACTICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: VERY HIGH (90%)

Can stakeholders in this survey BLOCK or INFLUENCE coaching decisions?
ANSWER: YES - These stakeholders have DIRECT POWER

Presidents/Chancellors (86% concerned about finances):
- Power: Control institutional budgets, hire/fire athletic directors, set strategic priorities
- Influence Mechanism: Can veto expensive coaching hires, mandate buyout reductions, cut sports
- Likelihood of Action: VERY HIGH (86% concerned = strong consensus for change)
- Evidence of Impact: Knight Commission has history of influencing NCAA policy (academic standards, financial reforms)

Athletic Directors (80% concerned about finances):
- Power: Direct hiring/firing authority over coaches, control athletic budgets
- Influence Mechanism: Make coaching retention decisions, negotiate contracts, structure buyouts
- Likelihood of Action: VERY HIGH (80% concerned = strong consensus)
- Evidence of Impact: Ross Bjork (Ohio State) $76M buyout context shows ADs already facing financial pressure

Faculty Athletics Representatives:
- Power: Influence through governance committees, academic standards enforcement
- Influence Mechanism: Can raise concerns about academic mission, delay decisions, require academic reviews
- Likelihood of Action: MODERATE (have voice but less direct authority than presidents/ADs)

CONCLUSION: These stakeholders WILL act on their concerns. 
86%/80% concern levels = policy changes LIKELY (contract reforms, buyout limits, coaching evaluation changes)

ETHICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: HIGH CONCERN (85%)

Are specific groups HARMED by coaching turnover? Survey provides clear evidence: YES

Women's Sports Athletes:
- Survey Finding: 72% of leaders say House settlement will have NEGATIVE impact on women's sports
- Connection to Coaching Turnover: Buyout costs + revenue sharing = budget pressure on women's programs
- Ethical Harm: Gender equity violations, program cuts, resource reallocation to revenue sports
- Stakeholder Voice: Women athletes NOT directly surveyed (ethical concern about whose voice matters)

Olympic Sports Athletes:
- Survey Finding: 73% of leaders say NEGATIVE impact on men's/women's Olympic sports
- Connection to Coaching Turnover: Non-revenue sports vulnerable when coaching costs escalate
- Ethical Harm: Program elimination, reduced scholarships, fewer opportunities
- Stakeholder Voice: Olympic sport athletes NOT surveyed (decisions made ABOUT them, not BY them)

Student-Athletes (Academic Mission):
- Survey Finding: 98-99% say academic mission important (full-time enrollment, graduation)
- Connection to Coaching Turnover: Coaching changes → roster instability → transfers → credit loss → graduation risk
- Ethical Harm: Academic progress compromised, degree completion threatened
- Stakeholder Voice: Student-athletes NOT surveyed (ironic given 98-99% say their education matters)

CEBMa Module 11 Principle: "Evaluate who is harmed"
VERDICT: Survey shows AWARENESS of harm (72-73% recognize it), but lacks VOICE of harmed parties
ETHICAL QUALITY: Survey captures ethical CONCERNS, but not ethical EXPERIENCES

========================================
SOURCE 2 APPRAISAL: 247SPORTS TRANSFER PORTAL DATA
========================================

DATA QUALITY: MODERATE (60%)

Source Credibility: HIGH (80%)
✅ 247Sports: Established sports media company, credible player tracking
✅ Transfer Portal data: Publicly verifiable (NCAA maintains official portal)
✅ Data type: Behavioral evidence (actual player movements, not opinions)
⚠️ Methodology: No documentation of how 247Sports collects/verifies transfer data

Data Completeness: MODERATE (65%)
✅ Iowa State 2016: Complete data (0 incoming, 0 outgoing = comprehensive)
⚠️ Context: Only ONE institution, ONE year, ONE sport (football)
❌ Comparative data: No comparison to typical coaching change transfer patterns
❌ Longitudinal data: No multi-year tracking to establish baseline

Representativeness: LOW (25%)
❌ Single case study: Iowa State is NOT representative of all D-I programs
❌ Unique context: Big 12 school, specific coaching hire (Matt Campbell), specific year (2016)
❌ Sport-specific: Football only (cannot generalize to basketball, Olympic sports)
❌ Era-specific: 2016 was BEFORE current transfer portal rules (immediate eligibility era started 2021)

BIAS ASSESSMENT

Selection Bias: VERY HIGH
Issue: Iowa State was chosen BECAUSE it's an interesting case (0 transfers unusual)
Bias Direction: Cherry-picking example that supports narrative (good hire = roster stability)
Counter-evidence missing: No data on coaching changes that DID cause mass transfers
CEBMa Concern: "Even random samples can be unrepresentative" - and this ISN'T random, it's purposive

Availability Bias: MODERATE
Issue: 247Sports data chosen because accessible, not because most rigorous source
Alternative sources: NCAA official portal data (more authoritative but less accessible)

Recency Bias: HIGH
Issue: 2016 data may not reflect CURRENT transfer portal environment
Context change: Transfer rules dramatically changed 2021 (immediate eligibility)
Relevance: 2016 pattern may not apply to 2024-2025 coaching changes

PRACTICAL VALUE: MODERATE (55%)
✅ Behavioral Evidence: Shows stakeholder (student-athlete) actions, not just opinions
✅ Validates Hire Quality Thesis: Good hire (Campbell) → roster stability → program success
⚠️ Limited Generalizability: One case cannot establish pattern
❌ Missing Stakeholder Voice: Transfer data shows BEHAVIOR but not REASONS (why did athletes stay?)

ETHICAL VALUE: LOW (30%)
❌ No Direct Voice: Student-athletes didn't explain their decisions
❌ No Counterfactual: Don't know what would have happened with different hire
❌ Selection: Only "successful" case shown, not cases where athletes were harmed

========================================
SOURCE 3 APPRAISAL: ATHLETIC DIRECTOR INTERVIEWS (REANALYZED)
========================================

DATA QUALITY: MODERATE (65%)

Source Credibility: HIGH (85%)
✅ Athletic Director U: Established professional development platform
✅ Sports Business Journal: Credible sports business publication
✅ The Athletic: Premium sports journalism with editorial standards
✅ Public statements: ADs spoke on record (not anonymous)

Sample Representativeness: LOW (35%)
❌ Small sample: Only 5 Athletic Directors
❌ Convenience sample: Selected based on availability/relevance, not random
❌ Conference diversity: Unclear if all conferences represented
❌ Institution type: Mix not documented (likely skewed toward larger programs)

Data Completeness: MODERATE (60%)
✅ Detailed context: Interviews provided rich qualitative insights
✅ Specific examples: Julie Cromer (portal), Ross Bjork ($76M buyouts), Kim Durand (AD turnover)
⚠️ Original purpose: Interviews conducted for practitioner evidence, not stakeholder analysis
❌ Limited depth on stakeholder concerns: Not all interviews asked about practical/ethical impacts

BIAS ASSESSMENT

Selection Bias: VERY HIGH
Issue: ADs chosen because they had relevant experiences (stability, instability, buyouts)
Bias Direction: Over-represents ADs with notable situations
Missing voices: ADs at smaller schools, ADs who haven't faced coaching turnover, ADs with different perspectives

Framing Bias: MODERATE
Issue: Interview questions likely framed around AD expertise, not stakeholder power/impact
Consequence: May have missed ethical/practical impact dimensions
Mitigation: Secondary reanalysis can extract stakeholder themes even if not primary focus

Publication Bias: MODERATE
Issue: Media outlets choose which ADs to interview/profile
Bias direction: Likely favor high-profile programs, controversial situations, name-brand schools
Missing: ADs at institutions with stable, uncontroversial programs

REPRESENTATIVENESS: LOW (30%)
Question: Do 5 ADs represent all D-I ADs?
Answer: NO - 5 out of ~363 ADs = 1.4% of population

Demographic match: UNKNOWN
- Conference representation: Not systematically diverse
- Institution type: Appears skewed toward FBS/larger programs
- Gender: Not tracked
- Experience level: Mix of established ADs (Gene Taylor) and interim ADs (Kim Durand)

PRACTICAL VALUE: MODERATE (60%)
✅ Direct Power: ADs have hiring/firing authority (high practical impact)
✅ Real Experiences: Examples like $76M buyouts show actual consequences
⚠️ Limited scope: 5 examples cannot establish patterns
❌ Missing comparisons: No ADs who disagree with coaching stability concerns

ETHICAL VALUE: LOW (35%)
⚠️ Partial awareness: Some ADs (Bjork) recognize financial harm, but not athlete-focused
❌ Institutional bias: ADs naturally prioritize institutional concerns over individual athlete welfare
❌ Power blind spot: ADs may not recognize their own power imbalances with athletes/coaches

========================================
COMBINED EVIDENCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT
========================================

OVERALL REPRESENTATIVENESS: MEDIUM (55%)

Stakeholder Groups Covered:

MEDIUM POWER stakeholders: 60% coverage (faculty/SWAs included but limited depth)
LOW POWER stakeholders: 20% coverage (athlete behavior data only; coaches/fans missing)

OVERALL CONFIDENCE LEVEL: MEDIUM (65%)

Confidence in Decision-Maker Perspectives: HIGH (85%)
- 376 D-I leaders surveyed with statistical validity
- 5 AD interviews provide qualitative depth
- Convergent findings: 86% transfer portal concerns, 80-86% financial concerns
- Practical impact clear: These stakeholders WILL act on concerns

Confidence in Affected Party Perspectives: LOW (35%)
- Student-athletes: Only behavioral evidence (ISU 2016: 0 transfers)
- Coaches: No direct evidence
- Women's/Olympic sport athletes: Recognition of harm (72-73%) but no direct voice
- Ethical impact acknowledged but not experienced from affected parties' view

Confidence in Full Stakeholder Landscape: MEDIUM (55%)
- Strong on institutional/administrative stakeholders
- Weak on individual/affected party stakeholders
- Missing external financial stakeholders (donors)

LIMITATIONS SUMMARY

1. SECONDARY SOURCES ONLY: No primary data collection conducted
   Impact: Cannot ask follow-up questions, probe deeper, or validate interpretations

2. SELECTION BIAS TOWARD HIGH POWER: Decision-makers over-represented, affected parties under-represented
   Impact: Institutional concerns privileged over athlete welfare concerns

3. SINGLE CASE STUDY: Iowa State 2016 is NOT generalizable
   Impact: Cannot establish patterns or claim broad applicability

4. TEMPORAL CONSTRAINTS: Knight Commission survey from August 2025 (recent but specific moment)
   Impact: May reflect current crisis (House settlement) more than long-term trends

5. MISSING STAKEHOLDER GROUPS: Donors, coaches, fans not included
   Impact: Incomplete stakeholder map, may miss critical perspectives

6. NO COUNTERFACTUAL: Don't know what stakeholders with POSITIVE coaching turnover experiences think
   Impact: May over-represent problems, under-represent successful transitions

STRENGTHS SUMMARY

1. STATISTICALLY VALID PRIMARY SOURCE: Knight Commission 376 respondents, +/-4.4% MOE
   Impact: Can confidently report decision-maker perspectives

2. HIGH-POWER STAKEHOLDER COVERAGE: Presidents (86% concerned), ADs (80% concerned) well-documented
   Impact: Practical impact assessment is STRONG (these stakeholders CAN act)

3. BEHAVIORAL EVIDENCE: Transfer portal data provides actions, not just opinions
   Impact: Validates that stakeholder concerns have real-world consequences

4. ETHICAL IMPACT RECOGNITION: 72-73% recognize harm to women's/Olympic sports
   Impact: Even decision-makers acknowledge ethical problems

5. CONVERGENT FINDINGS: Multiple sources (survey + interviews + behavioral data) point same direction
   Impact: Increases confidence that findings aren't artifact of single method

FINAL APPRAISAL: MODERATE QUALITY, HIGH PRACTICAL VALUE, MEDIUM ETHICAL VALUE

Quality Score: 65% (MEDIUM)
- Strong methodology for covered stakeholders (Knight Commission survey)
- Weak representativeness of full stakeholder landscape
- Appropriate transparency about limitations

Relevance Score: 80% (HIGH)  
- Directly addresses research question (stakeholder views on coaching turnover)
- High-power stakeholders covered (those who can ACT on findings)
- Practical impact clear (86%/80% concern = policy changes likely)

Confidence Score: 65% (MEDIUM)
- Can confidently report decision-maker perspectives
- Cannot confidently generalize to all stakeholder groups
- Ethical impact recognized but not experienced from affected parties

RECOMMENDATION: Use with Limitations Acknowledged
✅ DO: Report decision-maker concerns as valid and actionable
✅ DO: Acknowledge high practical impact (stakeholders have power)
✅ DO: Note ethical concerns raised by decision-makers
❌ DON'T: Claim to represent "all stakeholders"
❌ DON'T: Generalize Iowa State case beyond single example
❌ DON'T: Assume student-athlete behavioral data = student-athlete voice
