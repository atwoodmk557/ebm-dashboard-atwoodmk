STAKEHOLDER EVIDENCE - METHODS & ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY
Document Created: November 21, 2025
Project: Coaching Turnover Impact on Athletic Performance

RESEARCH QUESTION
How do stakeholders perceive and respond to coaching turnover in Division I athletics?

STAKEHOLDER EVIDENCE APPROACH: SECONDARY SOURCES ANALYSIS
This stakeholder evidence uses ONLY secondary sources - no primary data collection was conducted.
All evidence comes from published surveys, reports, and verified secondary data sources.

WHY STAKEHOLDER EVIDENCE MATTERS (CEBMa Module 11)
Stakeholder perceptions are "social facts" with actual effects on decision outcomes.
Stakeholders with POWER can block decisions or impede implementation.
Two types of impact assessed:
1. PRACTICAL IMPACT: Can stakeholders influence/block decisions about coaching stability?
2. ETHICAL IMPACT: Who is harmed by coaching turnover?

STAKEHOLDER MAP: POWER/INTEREST FRAMEWORK

HIGH POWER, HIGH INTEREST (Manage Closely):
- Presidents/Chancellors: Control budgets, strategic direction, institutional funding decisions
- Athletic Directors: Hire/fire coaches, manage athletic budgets, set retention policies
- Donors/Boosters: Fund programs, influence AD decisions through financial leverage

HIGH POWER, LOW INTEREST (Keep Satisfied):
- University Boards/Trustees: Governance oversight, rarely involved in day-to-day athletics
- Conference Officials: Rule-making authority, competitive balance concerns
- NCAA Governance: Regulatory power over transfer rules, eligibility policies

LOW POWER, HIGH INTEREST (Keep Informed):
- Student-Athletes: Directly affected by coaching changes, can transfer ("vote with feet")
- Coaching Staff: Job security concerns, affected by turnover decisions
- Faculty Athletics Representatives: Academic mission guardians, limited operational power

LOW POWER, LOW INTEREST (Monitor):
- General Public/Fans: Influence through attendance/viewership, limited direct power
- Media: Shape narratives, limited decision-making authority
- Alumni (non-donors): Emotional connection, minimal financial leverage

DATA SOURCES USED (SECONDARY SOURCES ONLY)

SOURCE 1: Knight Commission/Elon University Poll - Division I Leaders Survey
Date: October 9, 2025
URL: https://www.elon.edu/u/elon-poll/knight-commission-on-intercollegiate-athletics-division-i-leaders-survey/
Respondents: 376 NCAA Division I leaders (26% response rate, +/-4.4% margin of error)
Stakeholder Groups Surveyed:
- University Presidents and Chancellors
- Athletic Directors
- Senior Woman Administrators
- Faculty Athletics Representatives
Survey Design: Online Qualtrics survey, July 29 - August 22, 2025
Topics Assessed: Direction of D-I sports, transfer portal impact, financial concerns, governance structure

SOURCE 2: Transfer Portal Data - 247Sports.com
URL: https://247sports.com/college/iowa-state/Season/2016-Football/TransferPortal/
Data Type: Player transfer tracking database
Iowa State Case Study: 2016 coaching change (Paul Rhoads → Matt Campbell)
Variables: Incoming transfers, outgoing transfers during coaching transition
Finding: 0 incoming transfers, 0 outgoing transfers in 2016 (Campbell's first year)

SOURCE 3: Secondary Analysis of Existing AD Practitioner Interviews
Original Purpose: Practitioner evidence (Module 4)
Reframed For: Stakeholder evidence (Module 11)
Sources: Athletic Director U video interviews + Sports Business Journal/The Athletic articles
Stakeholder Group: Athletic Directors (HIGH power, HIGH interest decision-makers)
Number: 5 Athletic Directors from diverse institutions and conferences
Method: Published interviews and articles analyzed for stakeholder concerns, values, and implementation perspectives

STAKEHOLDER GROUPS INCLUDED IN EVIDENCE

✅ PRESIDENTS/CHANCELLORS (86% concerned about financial sustainability)
- Power Level: HIGH - Control institutional funding, strategic priorities
- Interest Level: HIGH - Institutional reputation, resource allocation at stake
- Evidence Source: Knight Commission survey (n=376 includes presidents/chancellors)

✅ ATHLETIC DIRECTORS (80% concerned about program sustainability)
- Power Level: HIGH - Direct hiring/firing authority, budget control
- Interest Level: HIGH - Career success tied to program performance
- Evidence Sources: Knight Commission survey + 5 AD interviews reanalyzed as stakeholder evidence

✅ FACULTY ATHLETICS REPRESENTATIVES
- Power Level: MEDIUM - Influence through governance committees
- Interest Level: HIGH - Academic mission protection
- Evidence Source: Knight Commission survey (included as respondent category)

✅ STUDENT-ATHLETES (indirect evidence only)
- Power Level: LOW - Can transfer but limited institutional power
- Interest Level: HIGH - Directly affected by coaching stability/turnover
- Evidence Source: Transfer Portal data (behavioral evidence of stakeholder responses)

❌ STAKEHOLDERS NOT INCLUDED (Limitation)
- Donors/Boosters: No direct survey or interview data available
- Coaching Staff: No direct voice captured (besides ADs managing them)
- General Public/Fans: No systematic sentiment analysis conducted
- Conference Officials: No direct statements obtained

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Informed Consent: All secondary sources were publicly available; no primary data collection requiring consent
Confidentiality: Knight Commission survey respondents were anonymous; AD interviews were public statements
No Harm: Secondary analysis only; no direct stakeholder contact
Bias Acknowledgment: Selection bias present (only high-power stakeholders well-represented)

LIMITATIONS OF STAKEHOLDER EVIDENCE APPROACH

1. SECONDARY SOURCES ONLY: No primary stakeholder interviews conducted
2. SELECTION BIAS: Over-representation of HIGH POWER stakeholders (ADs, presidents)
3. UNDER-REPRESENTATION: Student-athletes, donors, fans lack direct voice
4. TIMING: Knight Commission survey conducted August 2025 (recent but specific context: House v. NCAA settlement)
5. SELF-REPORT: Survey responses subject to social desirability bias
6. SINGLE INSTITUTION CASE: Transfer Portal data limited to Iowa State 2016 example

REPRESENTATIVENESS CONCERNS (CEBMa Module 11 Focus)

Who We Have:
✅ High-power decision-makers (presidents, ADs) - STRONG representation
✅ Internal institutional stakeholders - STRONG representation
✅ Multiple institution types (FBS, non-FBS) - ADEQUATE representation

Who We're Missing:
❌ Low-power affected parties (student-athletes, staff) - WEAK representation
❌ External financial stakeholders (donors, boosters) - NO representation
❌ Public stakeholders (fans, media) - NO representation

Confidence Level: MEDIUM
- Representative of DECISION-MAKER perspectives: STRONG
- Representative of AFFECTED PARTY perspectives: WEAK
- Overall stakeholder landscape: PARTIALLY REPRESENTATIVE
