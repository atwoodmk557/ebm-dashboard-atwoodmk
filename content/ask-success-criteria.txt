# Success Criteria Definition

## SMART Success Criteria

### Criterion 1: Extended Average Coach Tenure

- **Achievable:** Realistic given that retention strategies (multi-year contracts, performance transparency) can address controllable factors affecting job security
- **Relevant:** Directly addresses the core problem of short coaching tenure undermining program stability and team performance
- **Time-bound:** Achieve 5+ year average tenure within 3 years of implementing retention strategies

### Criterion 2: Improved Team Performance with Coaching Stability
- **Specific:** Win percentages and conference standings for Division I public university revenue sport programs with stable coaching (coaches with 3+ years tenure)
- **Measurable:** Programs with stable coaching achieve 10-15% higher win percentages and improve conference standings by 1-2 positions compared to programs with recent coaching changes
- **Achievable:** Research shows that coaching stability positively correlates with team performance and recruiting success
- **Relevant:** Demonstrates that extended coach tenure directly improves the athletic outcomes that Athletic Directors are measured on
- **Time-bound:** Measurable improvements visible within 2-3 years as coaching tenure extends beyond the 3.7 year average

### Criterion 3: Implementation of Coaching Retention Strategies
- **Specific:** Implementation and utilization of three key retention strategies: multi-year contract guarantees, performance evaluation transparency, and peer mentorship networks
- **Measurable:** 75% of revenue sport coaching positions have multi-year contracts, 100% have transparent evaluation processes, and 80% of coaches participate in peer mentorship programs
- **Achievable:** These strategies can be implemented within existing athletic department resources and state budget constraints
- **Relevant:** These specific interventions directly address the job security and support factors identified as primary causes of coaching turnover
- **Time-bound:** Multi-year contracts implemented by Year 1, transparent evaluations by Month 6, mentorship programs launched by Year 1 with 80% participation by Year 2
