===========================================================================

QUESTION 1: What is the average/median/trend for coaching employment?

MEDIAN WAGE: $45,920 (2024)
MEAN WAGE: $55,540 (2024)
Wage Range: $26,650 (10th percentile) to $89,560 (90th percentile)

10-YEAR EMPLOYMENT TREND (2014-2024):
Year    Employment    YoY Change    YoY %
2014    242,900       -             -
2016    251,600       +8,700        +3.6%
2018    278,300       +26,700       +10.6%
2020    279,100       +800          +0.3%  [COVID impact]
2022    299,100       +20,000       +7.2%
2024    306,500       +7,400        +2.5%

TREND: STABLE GROWTH - Coaching employment increased 26.2% over 10 years, 
averaging +6,360 jobs annually. Growth slowed during COVID (2020) but recovered 
strongly. Recent growth (2022-2024) shows continued expansion but at slower pace.

QUESTION 2: How does Educational Services compare to other industries?

EMPLOYMENT BY INDUSTRY (May 2024):
Industry                          Employment    % of Total
Educational Services              87,600        28.6%  ← LARGEST
Fitness/Recreation Centers        52,400        17.1%
Other Amusement/Recreation        38,900        12.7%
Spectator Sports                  31,200        10.2%
Religious Organizations           12,700        4.1%
Other Industries                  83,700        27.3%
TOTAL                             306,500       100%

FINDING: Educational Services (colleges, universities, K-12 schools) employs 
the MOST coaches - nearly 1 in 3 coaches work in education. This makes educational 
institutions critical to coaching profession stability.

Spectator Sports (professional/college athletics) only represents 10.2%, suggesting 
most coaches work in instructional/developmental roles rather than elite competition.

QUESTION 3: What patterns exist across regions? (Iowa Context)

TOP 10 STATES BY COACHING EMPLOYMENT:
State            Employment    % of National
California       34,290        11.18%
Texas            28,130        9.17%
New York         18,930        6.17%
Florida          18,710        6.10%
Pennsylvania     12,580        4.10%
Ohio             11,160        3.64%
Illinois         10,810        3.53%
Massachusetts    10,370        3.38%
Michigan         9,740         3.18%
Virginia         9,140         2.98%

IOWA: 4,590 coaches (1.50% of national total)

PATTERN: Large population states dominate (CA, TX, NY, FL account for 32.6% of 
all coaches). Iowa ranks ~20th nationally, proportional to population size.

Iowa has ~1,500 jobs per million residents, comparable to national average, 
suggesting coaching employment aligns with state size.

DATA → INFORMATION → EVIDENCE CYCLE

DATA: BLS reports 306,500 coaches employed nationally in May 2024, with 87,600 
in educational services.

INFORMATION: Employment grew 26.2% over 10 years (2014-2024), with educational 
services representing the largest industry sector at 28.6%.

EVIDENCE: Steady employment growth suggests the coaching profession is STABLE 
and EXPANDING, NOT experiencing widespread turnover-driven exits. However, this 
does NOT measure WITHIN-POSITION turnover (coaches changing schools/teams). BLS 
tracks profession-level employment, not organizational-level job changes.

LIMITATION: BLS data measures total employment (how many coaching jobs exist), 
NOT turnover rates (how often coaches change positions). A stable employment 
number could mask HIGH turnover if coaches constantly switch organizations.

RELEVANCE TO X→Y HYPOTHESIS:
- BLS data provides CONTEXT on profession stability
- Does NOT directly measure coaching turnover (X variable)
- Does NOT measure team performance (Y variable)
- CONCLUSION: Need organizational records (NCAA data, university athletics 
  reports) to actually test X→Y relationship

CASE STUDY 1: IOWA STATE COACHING TRANSITION (2015-2016)

COACHING CHANGE:
Paul Rhoads  Matt Campbell (after 2015 season)

PAUL RHOADS ERA (2009-2015):
Year    Overall  Big 12  Bowl        Notes
2009    7-6      3-5     Insight W   Strong start
2010    5-7      3-5     No bowl     
2011    6-7      3-6     Pinstripe L
2012    6-7      3-6     Liberty L
2013    3-9      2-7     No bowl     DECLINE BEGINS
2014    2-10     0-9     No bowl     WORST SEASON
2015    3-9      2-7     No bowl     Rhoads fired

Performance Trajectory: 
- Early success (2009-2012): Average 6-7 wins
- Steep decline (2013-2015): 2.7 wins average
- PATTERN: X (turnover) preceded by Y (performance decline)

MATT CAMPBELL ERA (2016-2025):
Year    Overall  Big 12  Bowl        Ranking  Notes
2016    3-9      2-7     No bowl              Rebuilding year
2017    8-5      5-4     Liberty W            IMPROVEMENT
2018    8-5      6-3     Alamo L      #24     Top 25
2019    7-6      5-4     Camping W    #22     
2020    9-3      8-1     Fiesta W     #10     TOP 10!
2021    7-6      5-4     Cheez-It L           
2022    4-8      1-8     No bowl              Transfer impact
2023    7-6      6-3     Liberty L            
2024    11-3     7-2     Pop-Tarts W  #18     Conference runner-up
2025    6-4      3-4     (ongoing)            

Performance Trajectory:
- Immediate dip (2016): 3-9 (expected rebuild)
- Consistent improvement (2017-2020): Peak at 9-3, #10 ranking
- One bad year (2022): 4-8 (transfer portal disruption)
- Recovery (2023-2024): Return to 7+ wins, 11-3 peak season
- SUSTAINED SUCCESS: 7.7 wins/season average (2017-2024)

===========================================================================

DATA  INFORMATION  EVIDENCE CYCLE APPLICATION:

DATA (RAW NUMBERS):
- Paul Rhoads: 2-10 (2014), 3-9 (2015) = 5-19 last two years
- Matt Campbell: 3-9 (2016 transition), then sustained 7+ wins average

INFORMATION (PROCESSED MEANING):
- Performance DECLINED in years BEFORE coaching change (2013-2015)
- Coaching change was RESPONSE TO decline, not cause of it
- New coach Campbell took 1 transition year, then stabilized program
- Average wins increased from 2.7 (Rhoads 2013-15) to 7.7 (Campbell 2017-24)

EVIDENCE (HYPOTHESIS TESTING):
DOES coaching turnover CAUSE performance decline? 
ISU CASE: NO - Performance declined FIRST, turnover was organizational response
HOWEVER: Turnover did create SHORT-TERM disruption (1 year rebuild)
BUT: Long-term stability under new coach IMPROVED performance significantly

CONCLUSION: Coaching turnover can be either:
  A) RESPONSE to existing decline (ISU Paul Rhoads case)
  B) CATALYST for improvement if right hire made (ISU Matt Campbell case)
  C) Both simultaneously (decline triggers change, change enables recovery)
