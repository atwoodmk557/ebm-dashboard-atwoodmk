## PICOC Framework
### Population (P - Who is affected by this problem?)
- **Primary**: Athletic directors and administrators at Division I public universities who are responsible for revenue sport program performance and coaching retention decisions
- **Secondary**: Revenue sport athletes who experience disruption from coaching changes
- **Tertiary**: Coaching staff (both departing and incoming), support staff, recruits and their families, alumni, and university stakeholders

### Intervention (I - What solution/action are we considering?)
Implementing coaching retention strategies focused on: multi-year contract guarantees to enhance job security, performance evaluation transparency with clear and fair metrics, and peer mentorship networks to connect coaches across similar programs for support and professional development.

### Comparison (C - What alternatives exist?)
- **Status quo**: Continue current hiring/retention practices
- **Minimal intervention**: Focus only on salary increases
- **Partial solution**: Address only hiring OR retention, not both
- **Alternative approach**: Outsource coaching recruitment to specialized firms

### Outcomes (O - What will success look like?)
- **Increased team performance** measured by higher win percentages and improved conference standings
- **Enhanced program stability** measured by longer average coach tenure (target: increase from current 3.7 years to 5+ years within 3 years, based on Athletic Director U coaching carousel study)

### Context (C - Where/when does this apply?)
Division I public university revenue sport programs where state funding pressures and budget constraints contribute to higher coaching turnover rates compared to private institutions.

## Clear Problem Statement
High coaching turnover rates in Division I public university revenue sport programs (averaging only 3.7 years tenure) are undermining program stability and negatively impacting team performance.

## Why This Problem Matters
### Impact on Organization
Poor coaching management leads to decreased program competitiveness, reduced recruiting effectiveness, increased operational costs from constant hiring/training, damaged reputation affecting donations and enrollment, and potential NCAA compliance issues. Athletic departments lose institutional knowledge and continuity essential for long-term success.

### Stakeholder Impact
**Athletic directors** at Division I public universities struggle with state funding pressures, budget constraints, and performance expectations while facing higher coaching turnover rates that undermine program stability. **Revenue sport athletes** experience disrupted relationships, inconsistent training methods, and uncertainty about program direction. **Coaches** face job insecurity and limited career development opportunities. **Alumni and donors** lose confidence in program direction and reduce support. **University administration** deals with negative publicity and reduced revenue potential from underperforming programs.

### Strategic Alignment
Effective coaching retention directly supports Division I public university goals of competitive excellence, financial sustainability, and institutional reputation. Stable coaching leadership (extending tenure beyond the current 3.7 years) enhances team performance, improves recruiting success, and generates positive community engagement - all critical to public university strategic objectives and maximizing return on state funding investments.
